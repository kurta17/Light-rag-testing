Then a mutual\nacquaintance put us in touch, launching a friendship that led to this project and\nseems destined to last a lifetime.\nThe next time we got together, a year later, we strolled through a park in\ndowntown Tokyo and ended up talking about trends in Western psychology,\nspecifically logotherapy, which helps people find their purpose in life.\nWe remarked that Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy had gone out of fashion among\npracticing therapists, who favored other schools of psychology, though people\nstill search for meaning in what they do and how they live. We ask ourselves\nthings like:\nWhat is the meaning of my life?\nIs the point just to live longer, or should I seek a higher purpose?\nWhy do some people know what they want and have a passion for life, while\nothers languish in confusion?\nAt some point in our conversation, the mysterious word ikigai came up.\nThis Japanese concept, which translates roughly as “the happiness of always\nbeing busy,” is like logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond. It also seems to be one\nway of explaining the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese, especially on the\nisland of Okinawa, where there are 24.55 people over the age of 100 for every\n100,000 inhabitants—far more than the global average.\nThose who study why the inhabitants of this island in the south of Japan live\nlonger than people anywhere else in the world believe that one of the keys—inaddition to a healthful diet, a simple life in the outdoors, green tea, and the\nsubtropical climate (its average temperature is like that of Hawaii)—is the ikigai\nthat shapes their lives.\nWhile researching this concept, we discovered that not a single book in the\nfields of psychology or personal development is dedicated to bringing this\nphilosophy to the West.\nIs ikigai the reason there are more centenarians in Okinawa than anywhere\nelse? How does it inspire people to stay active until the very end? What is the\nsecret to a long and happy life?\nAs we explored the matter further, we discovered that one place in particular,\nOgimi, a rural town on the north end of the island with a population of three\nthousand, boasts the highest life expectancy in the world—a fact that has earned\nit the nickname the Village of Longevity.\nOkinawa is where most of Japan’s shikuwasa—a limelike fruit that packs an\nextraordinary antioxidant punch—comes from. Could that be Ogimi’s secret to\nlong life? Or is it the purity of the water used to brew its Moringa tea?\nWe decided to go study the secrets of the Japanese centenarians in person.\nAfter a year of preliminary research we arrived in the village—where residents\nspeak an ancient dialect and practice an animist religion that features long-haired\nforest sprites called bunagaya—with our cameras and recording devices in hand.\nAs soon as we arrived we could sense the incredible friendliness of its residents,\nwho laughed and joked incessantly amid lush green hills fed by crystalline waters.\nAs we conducted our interviews with the eldest residents of the town, we\nrealized that something far more powerful than just these natural resources was at\nwork: an uncommon joy flows from its inhabitants and guides them through the\nlong and pleasurable journey of their lives.\nAgain, the mysterious ikigai.\nBut what is it, exactly? How do you get it?\nIt never ceased to surprise us that this haven of nearly eternal life was located\nprecisely in Okinawa, where two hundred thousand innocent lives were lost at the\nend of World War II. Rather than harbor animosity toward outsiders, however,\nOkinawans live by the principle of ichariba chode, a local expression that means\n“treat everyone like a brother, even if you’ve never met them before.”\nIt turns out that one of the secrets to happiness of Ogimi’s residents is feeling\nlike part of a community. From an early age they practice yuimaaru, or\nteamwork, and so are used to helping one another.Nurturing friendships, eating light, getting enough rest, and doing regular,\nmoderate exercise are all part of the equation of good health, but at the heart of\nthe joie de vivre that inspires these centenarians to keep celebrating birthdays and\ncherishing each new day is their ikigai.\nThe purpose of this book is to bring the secrets of Japan’s centenarians to you\nand give you the tools to find your own ikigai.\nBecause those who discover their ikigai have everything they need for a long\nand joyful journey through life.\nHappy travels!\nHÉCTOR GARCÍA AND FRANCESC M\nIRALLESI\nIKIGAI\nThe art of staying young while\ngrowing oldWhat is your reason for being?\nAccording to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—what a French philosopher\nmight call a raison d’être. Some people have found their ikigai, while others are\nstill looking, though they carry it within them.\nOur ikigai is hidden deep inside each of us, and finding it requires a patient\nsearch. According to those born on Okinawa, the island with the most\ncentenarians in the world, our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.Whatever you do, don’t retire!\nHaving a clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to our\nlives. The purpose of this book is to help you find yours, and to share insights\nfrom Japanese philosophy on the lasting health of body, mind, and spirit.\nOne surprising thing you notice, living in Japan, is how active people remain\nafter they retire. In fact, many Japanese people never really retire—they keep\ndoing what they love for as long as their health allows.\nThere is, in fact, no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of “leaving\nthe workforce for good” as in English. According to Dan Buettner, a National\nGeographic reporter who knows the country well, having a purpose in life is so\nimportant in Japanese culture that our idea of retirement simply doesn’t exist\nthere.\nThe island of (almost) eternal youth\nCertain longevity studies suggest that a strong sense of community and a clearly\ndefined ikigai are just as important as the famously healthful Japanese diet—\nperhaps even more so. Recent medical studies of centenarians from Okinawa and\nother so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions where people live longest—\nprovide a number of interesting facts about these extraordinary human beings:\nNot only do they live much longer than the rest of the world’s population,\nthey also suffer from fewer chronic illnesses such as cancer and heart\ndisease; inflammatory disorders are also less common.\nMany of these centenarians enjoy enviable levels of vitality and health that\nwould be unthinkable for people of advanced age elsewhere.\nTheir blood tests reveal fewer free radicals (which are responsible for\ncellular aging), as a result of drinking tea and eating until their stomachs are\nonly 80 percent full.\nWomen experience more moderate symptoms during menopause, and both\nmen and women maintain higher levels of sexual hormones until much later\nin life.\nThe rate of dementia is well below the global average.The Characters Behind Ikigai\nIn Japanese, ikigai is written as 生き甲斐, combining 生き, which means\n“life,” with 甲斐, which means “to be worthwhile.” 甲斐 can be broken\ndown into the characters 甲, which means “armor,” “number one,” and “to\nbe the first” (to head into battle, taking initiative as a leader), and 斐,\nwhich means “beautiful” or “elegant.”\nThough we will consider each of these findings over the course of the book,\nresearch clearly indicates that the Okinawans’ focus on ikigai gives a sense of\npurpose to each and every day and plays an important role in their health and\nlongevity.\nThe five Blue Zones\nOkinawa holds first place among the world’s Blue Zones. In Okinawa, women in\nparticular live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world.\nThe five regions identified and analyzed by Dan Buettner in his book The Blue\nZones are:\n1. Okinawa, Japan (especially the northern part of the island). The locals eat a\ndiet rich in vegetables and tofu typically served on small plates. In addition to\ntheir philosophy of ikigai, the moai, or close-knit group of friends (see page\n15), plays an important role in their longevity.\n2. Sardinia, Italy (specifically the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra). Locals on\nthis island consume plenty of vegetables and one or two glasses of wine per\nday. As in Okinawa, the cohesive nature of this community is another factor\ndirectly related to longevity.\n3. Loma Linda, California. Researchers studied a group of Seventh-day\nAdventists who are among the longest-living people in the United States.\n4. The Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. Locals remain remarkably active after\nninety; many of the region’s older residents have no problem getting up at\nfive thirty in the morning to work in the fields.5. Ikaria, Greece. One of every three inhabitants of this island near the coast of\nTurkey is over ninety years old (compared to less than 1 percent of the\npopulation of the United States), a fact that has earned it the nickname the\nIsland of Long Life. The local secret seems to be a lifestyle that dates back to\n500 BC.\nIn the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the\nkeys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to\nOkinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth\npointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce\nand communities have to help one another.\nFor many, helping others might be an ikigai strong enough to keep them alive.\nAccording to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to\nlongevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming\nstrong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family\nrelations.\nMembers of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce\nstress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.1\nThey don’t do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks\nand working in their vegetable gardens. People in the Blue Zones would rather\nwalk than drive. Gardening, which involves daily low-intensity movement, is a\npractice almost all of them have in common.\nThe 80 percent secret\nOne of the most common sayings in Japan is “Hara hachi bu,” which is repeated\nbefore or after eating and means something like “Fill your belly to 80 percent.”\nAncient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans\nstop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity,\nrather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive\nprocesses that accelerate cellular oxidation.\nOf course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80\npercent capacity. The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating\nwhen we are starting to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we\nknow in our hearts we don’t really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these willgive us pleasure in the short term, but not having them will make us happier in\nthe long term.\nThe way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many\nsmall plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan\nis served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish\nslightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are\ngoing to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling\nslightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose\nweight and stay trim.\nRecent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average\nof 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and\nhave a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United\nStates.\nThe Okinawan diet is rich in tofu, sweet potatoes, fish (three times per week),\nand vegetables (roughly 11 ounces per day). In the chapter dedicated to nutrition\nwe will see which healthy, antioxidant-rich foods are included in this 80 percent.\nMoai: Connected for life\nIt is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai\nis an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one\nanother. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.\nThe moai has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to\nshare best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests.\nMembers of a moai make a set monthly contribution to the group. This\npayment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and shogi\n(Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common.\nThe funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money\nleft over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from\nthe surplus. In this way, being part of a moai helps maintain emotional and\nfinancial stability. If a member of a moai is in financial trouble, he or she can get\nan advance from the group’s savings. While the details of each moai’s accounting\npractices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of\nbelonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase\nlife expectancy.• • •\nFOLLOWING THIS BRIEF introduction to the topics covered in this book, we look at\na few causes of premature aging in modern life, and then explore different\nfactors related to ikigai.II\nANTIAGING SECRETS\nLittle things that add up to a long\nand happy lifeAging’s escape velocity\nFor more than a century, we’ve managed to add an average of 0.3 years to our life\nexpectancy every year. But what would happen if we had the technology to add a\nyear of life expectancy every year? In theory, we would achieve biological\nimmortality, having reached aging’s “escape velocity.”\nAging’s Escape Velocity and the Rabbit\nImagine a sign far off in the future with a number on it that\nrepresents the age of your death. Every year that you live,\nyou advance closer to the sign. When you reach the sign, you die.\nNow imagine a rabbit holding the sign and walking to the future. Every\nyear that you live, the rabbit is half a year as far away. After a while, you\nwill reach the rabbit and die.\nBut what if the rabbit could walk at a pace of one year for every year\nof your life? You would never be able to catch the rabbit, and therefore\nyou would never die.\nThe speed at which the rabbit walks to the future is our technology.\nThe more we advance technology and knowledge of our bodies, the faster\nwe can make the rabbit walk.\nAging’s escape velocity is the moment at which the rabbit walks at a\npace of one year per year or faster, and we become immortal.\nResearchers with an eye to the future, such as Ray Kurzweil and Aubrey de\nGrey, claim that we’ll reach this escape velocity in a matter of decades. Other\nscientists are less optimistic, predicting that we’ll reach a limit, a maximum age\nwe won’t be able to surpass, no matter how much technology we have. For\nexample, some biologists assert that our cells stop regenerating after about 120\nyears.\nActive mind, youthful body\nThere is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“aThere is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a\nsound mind in a sound body”): It reminds us that both mind and body are\nimportant, and that the health of one is connected to that of the other. It has been\nshown that maintaining an active, adaptable mind is one of the key factors in\nstaying young.\nHaving a youthful mind also drives you toward a healthy lifestyle that will\nslow the aging process.\nJust as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and\nmood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and\nneural connections to deteriorate—and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to\nour surroundings.\nThis is why it’s so important to give your brain a workout.\nOne pioneer in advocating for mental exercise is the Israeli neuroscientist\nShlomo Breznitz, who argues that the brain needs a lot of stimulation in order to\nstay in shape. As he stated in an interview with Eduard Punset for the Spanish\ntelevision program Redes:\nThere is a tension between what is good for someone and what they want to do. This is because people,\nespecially older people, like to do things as they’ve always done them. The problem is that when the\nbrain develops ingrained habits, it doesn’t need to think anymore. Things get done quickly and\nefficiently on automatic pilot, often in a very advantageous way. This creates a tendency to stick to\nroutines, and the only way of breaking these is to confront the brain with new information.1\nPresented with new information, the brain creates new connections and is\nrevitalized. This is why it is so important to expose yourself to change, even if\nstepping outside your comfort zone means feeling a bit of anxiety.\nThe effects of mental training have been scientifically demonstrated.\nAccording to Collins Hemingway and Shlomo Breznitz in their book Maximum\nBrainpower: Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom, mental training is\nbeneficial on many levels: “You begin exercising your brain by doing a certain\ntask for the first time,” he writes. “And at first it seems very difficult, but as you\nlearn how to do it, the training is already working. The second time, you realize\nthat it’s easier, not harder, to do, because you’re getting better at it. This has a\nfantastic effect on a person’s mood. In and of itself, it is a transformation that\naffects not only the results obtained, but also his or her self-image.”\nThis description of a “mental workout” might sound a bit formal, but simply\ninteracting with others—playing a game, for example—offers new stimuli and\nhelps prevent the depression that can come with solitude.\nOur neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process isOur neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is\nslowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. Dealing\nwith new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and\ninteracting with other people seem to be essential antiaging strategies for the\nmind. Furthermore, a more positive outlook in this regard will yield greater\nmental benefits.\nStress: Accused of killing longevity\nMany people seem older than they are. Research into the causes of premature\naging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it, because the body wears down\nmuch faster during periods of crisis. The American Institute of Stress\ninvestigated this degenerative process and concluded that most health problems\nare caused by stress.\nResearchers at the Heidelberg University Hospital conducted a study in which\nthey subjected a young doctor to a job interview, which they made even more\nstressful by forcing him to solve complex math problems for thirty minutes.\nAfterward, they took a blood sample. What they discovered was that his\nantibodies had reacted to stress the same way they react to pathogens, activating\nthe proteins that trigger an immune response. The problem is that this response\nnot only neutralizes harmful agents, it also damages healthy cells, leading them to\nage prematurely.\nThe University of California conducted a similar study, taking data and\nsamples from thirty-nine women who had high levels of stress due to the illness\nof one of their children and comparing them to samples from women with\nhealthy children and low levels of stress. They found that stress promotes cellular\naging by weakening cell structures known as telomeres, which affect cellular\nregeneration and how our cells age. As the study revealed, the greater the stress,\nthe greater the degenerative effect on cells.\nHow does stress work?\nThese days, people live at a frantic pace and in a nearly constant state of\ncompetition. At this fever pitch, stress is a natural response to the information\nbeing received by the body as potentially dangerous or problematic.\nTheoretically, this is a useful reaction, as it helps us survive in hostile\nsurroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response tosurroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response to\ndeal with difficult situations and to flee from predators.\nThe alarm that goes off in our head makes our neurons activate the pituitary\ngland, which produces hormones that release corticotropin, which in turn\ncirculates through the body via the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal\ngland is then triggered to release adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline raises our\nrespiratory rate and pulse and prepares our muscles for action, getting the body\nready to react to perceived danger, while cortisol increases the release of\ndopamine and blood glucose, which is what gets us “charged up” and allows us to\nface challenges.\nCave Dwellers Modern Humans\nWere relaxed most of the time. Work most of the time and are alert to any and all threats.\nFelt stress only in very specific Are online or waiting for notifications from their cell phones twenty-four hours a\nsituations. day.\nThe threats were real: A predator could The brain associates the ping of a cell phone or an e-mail notification with the\nend their lives at any moment. threat of a predator.\nHigh doses of cortisol and adrenaline at Low doses of cortisol flow constantly through the body, with implications for a\nmoments of danger kept the body range of health problems, including adrenal fatigue and chronic fatigue\nhealthy. syndrome.\nThese processes are, in moderation, beneficial—they help us overcome\nchallenges in our daily lives. Nonetheless, the stress to which human beings are\nsubjected today is clearly harmful.\nStress has a degenerative effect over time. A sustained state of emergency\naffects the neurons associated with memory, as well as inhibiting the release of\ncertain hormones, the absence of which can cause depression. Its secondary\neffects include irritability, insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure.\nAs such, though challenges are good for keeping mind and body active, we\nshould adjust our high-stress lifestyles in order to avoid the premature aging of\nour bodies.\nBe mindful about reducing stress\nWhether or not the threats we perceive are real, stress is an easily identifiable\ncondition that not only causes anxiety but is also highly psychosomatic, affecting\neverything from our digestive system to our skin.This is why prevention is so important in avoiding the toll that stress takes on\nus—and why many experts recommend practicing mindfulness.\nThe central premise of this stress-reduction method is focusing on the self:\nnoticing our responses, even if they are conditioned by habit, in order to be fully\nconscious of them. In this way, we connect with the here and now and limit\nthoughts that tend to spiral out of control.\n“We have to learn to turn off the autopilot that’s steering us in an endless loop.\nWe all know people who snack while talking on the phone or watching the news.\nYou ask them if the omelet they just ate had onion in it, and they can’t tell you,”\nsays Roberto Alcibar, who abandoned his fast-paced life to become a certified\ninstructor of mindfulness after an illness threw him into a period of acute stress.\nOne way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps\nfilter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be\nachieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans.\nAchieving mindfulness involves a gradual process of training, but with a bit of\npractice we can learn to focus our mind completely, which reduces stress and\nhelps us live longer.\nA little stress is good for you\nWhile sustained, intense stress is a known enemy of longevity and both mental\nand physical health, low levels of stress have been shown to be beneficial.\nAfter observing a group of test subjects for more than twenty years, Dr.\nHoward S. Friedman, a psychology professor at the University of California,\nRiverside, discovered that people who maintained a low level of stress, who faced\nchallenges and put their heart and soul into their work in order to succeed, lived\nlonger than those who chose a more relaxed lifestyle and retired earlier. From\nthis, he concluded that a small dose of stress is a positive thing, as those who live\nwith low levels of stress tend to develop healthier habits, smoke less, and drink\nless alcohol.2\nGiven this, it is not surprising that many of the supercentenarians—people\nwho live to be 110 or more—whom we’ll meet in this book talk about having\nlived intense lives and working well into old age.\nA lot of sitting will age youIn the Western world in particular, the rise in sedentary behavior has led to\nnumerous diseases such as hypertension and obesity, which in turn affect\nlongevity.\nSpending too much time seated at work or at home not only reduces muscular\nand respiratory fitness but also increases appetite and curbs the desire to\nparticipate in activities. Being sedentary can lead to hypertension, imbalanced\neating, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even certain kinds of cancer.\nRecent studies have shown a connection between a lack of physical activity and\nthe progressive distortion of telomeres in the immune system, which ages those\ncells and, in turn, the organism as a whole.\nThis is a problem at all life stages, not only among adults. Sedentary children\nsuffer from high rates of obesity and all its associated health issues and risks,\nwhich is why it’s so important to develop a healthy and active lifestyle at an early\nage.\nIt’s easy to be less sedentary; it just takes a bit of effort and a few changes to\nyour routine. We can access a more active lifestyle that makes us feel better\ninside and out—we just have to add a few ingredients to our everyday habits:\nWalk to work, or just go on a walk for at least twenty minutes each day.\nUse your feet instead of an elevator or escalator. This is good for your\nposture, your muscles, and your respiratory system, among other things.\nParticipate in social or leisure activities so that you don’t spend too much time\nin front of the television.\nReplace your junk food with fruit and you’ll have less of an urge to snack,\nand more nutrients in your system.\nGet the right amount of sleep. Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than\nthat makes us lethargic.\nPlay with children or pets, or join a sports team. This not only strengthens the\nbody but also stimulates the mind and boosts self-esteem.\nBe conscious of your daily routine in order to detect harmful habits and\nreplace them with more positive ones.\nBy making these small changes, we can begin to renew our bodies and minds\nand increase our life expectancy.\nA model’s best-kept secretA model’s best-kept secret\nThough we age both externally and internally, both physically and mentally, one\nof the things that tell us the most about people’s age is their skin, which takes on\ndifferent textures and colors according to processes going on beneath the surface.\nMost of those who make their living as models claim to sleep between nine and\nten hours the night before a fashion show. This gives their skin a taut, wrinkle-\nfree appearance and a healthy, radiant glow.\nScience has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep\nwe generate melatonin, a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal\ngland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal\nand nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles.\nA powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the\nfollowing benefits:\nIt strengthens the immune system.\nIt contains an element that protects against cancer.\nIt promotes the natural production of insulin.\nIt slows the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.\nIt helps prevent osteoporosis and fight heart disease.\nFor all these reasons, melatonin is a great ally in preserving youth. It should be\nnoted, however, that melatonin production decreases after age thirty. We can\ncompensate for this by:\nEating a balanced diet and getting more calcium.\nSoaking up a moderate amount of sun each day.\nGetting enough sleep.\nAvoiding stress, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, all of which make it harder\nto get a good night’s rest, depriving us of the melatonin we need.\nExperts are trying to determine whether artificially stimulating production of\nmelatonin might help slow the aging process . . . which would confirm the theory\nthat we already carry the secret to longevity within us.\nAntiaging attitudesThe mind has tremendous power over the body and how quickly it ages. Most\ndoctors agree that the secret to keeping the body young is keeping the mind active\n—a key element of ikigai—and in not caving in when we face difficulties\nthroughout our lives.\nOne study, conducted at Yeshiva University, found that the people who live\nthe longest have two dispositional traits in common: a positive attitude and a high\ndegree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a\npositive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their\nway toward longevity.\nA stoic attitude—serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you\nyoung, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be\nseen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate\nlifestyles.\nMany centenarians and supercentenarians have similar profiles: They have had\nfull lives that were difficult at times, but they knew how to approach these\nchallenges with a positive attitude and not be overwhelmed by the obstacles they\nfaced.\nAlexander Imich, who in 2014 became the world’s oldest living man at age\n111, knew he had good genes but understood that other factors contributed, too:\n“The life you live is equally or more important for longevity,” he said in an\ninterview with Reuters after being added to Guinness World Records in 2014.\nAn ode to longevity\nDuring our stay in Ogimi, the village that holds the Guinness record for longevity,\na woman who was about to turn 100 years old sang the following song for us in a\nmixture of Japanese and the local dialect:\nTo keep healthy and have a long life,\neat just a little of everything with relish,\ngo to bed early, get up early, and then go out for a walk.\nWe live each day with serenity and we enjoy the journey.\nTo keep healthy and have a long life,\nwe get on well with all of our friends.\nSpring, summer, fall, winter,\nwe happily enjoy all the seasons.\nThe secret is to not get distracted by how old the fingers are;The secret is to not get distracted by how old the fingers are;\nfrom the fingers to the head and back once again.\nIf you keep moving with your fingers working, 100 years\nwill come to you.*\nWe can now use our fingers to turn the page to the next chapter, where we will\nlook at the close relationship between longevity and discovering our life’s\nmission.III\nFROM LOGOTHERAPY TO IKIGAI\nHow to live longer and better by\nfinding your purposeWhat is logotherapy?\nA colleague once asked Viktor Frankl to define his school of psychology in a\nsingle phrase, to which Frankl replied, “Well, in logotherapy the patient sits up\nstraight and has to listen to things that are, on occasion, hard to hear.” The\ncolleague had just described psychoanalysis to him in the following terms: “In\npsychoanalysis, the patient lies down on a couch and tells you things that are, on\noccasion, hard to say.”\nFrankl explains that one of the first questions he would ask his patients was\n“Why do you not commit suicide?” Usually the patient found good reasons not to,\nand was able to carry on. What, then, does logotherapy do? 1\nThe answer is pretty clear: It helps you find reasons to live.\nLogotherapy pushes patients to consciously discover their life’s purpose in\norder to confront their neuroses. Their quest to fulfill their destiny then motivates\nthem to press forward, breaking the mental chains of the past and overcoming\nwhatever obstacles they encounter along the way.\nSomething to Live For\nA study conducted by Frankl in his Vienna clinic found that among both\npatients and personnel, around 80 percent believed that human beings\nneeded a reason for living, and around 60 percent felt they had someone\nor something in their lives worth dying for.2\nThe search for meaning\nThe search for purpose became a personal, driving force that allowed Frankl to\nachieve his goals. The process of logotherapy can be summarized in these five\nsteps:1. A person feels empty, frustrated, or anxious.\n2. The therapist shows him that what he is feeling is the desire to have a\nmeaningful life.\n3. The patient discovers his life’s purpose (at that particular point in time).\n4. Of his own free will, the patient decides to accept or reject that destiny.\n5. This newfound passion for life helps him overcome obstacles and sorrows.\nFrankl himself would live and die for his principles and ideals. His\nexperiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz showed him that “Everything can be taken\nfrom a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s\nattitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”3 It was\nsomething he had to go through alone, without any help, and it inspired him for\nthe rest of his life.\nTen Differences Between Psychoanalysis and Logotherapy\nPsychoanalysis Logotherapy\nThe patient sits facing the therapist, who guides him or her without\nThe patient reclines on a couch, like a patient.\npassing judgment.\nIs retrospective: It looks to the past.

In Frankl’s view, however, there is no need to see this\nfrustration as an anomaly or a symptom of neurosis; instead, it can be a positive\nthing—a catalyst for change.thing—a catalyst for change.\nLogotherapy does not see this frustration as mental illness, the way other forms\nof therapy do, but rather as spiritual anguish—a natural and beneficial\nphenomenon that drives those who suffer from it to seek a cure, whether on their\nown or with the help of others, and in so doing to find greater satisfaction in life.\nIt helps them change their own destiny.\nLogotherapy enters the picture if the person needs help doing this, if he needs\nguidance in discovering his life’s purpose and later in overcoming conflicts so he\ncan keep moving toward his objective. In Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl cites\none of Nietzsche’s famous aphorisms: “He who has a why to live for can bear\nwith almost any how.”\nBased on his own experience, Frankl believed that our health depends on that\nnatural tension that comes from comparing what we’ve accomplished so far with\nwhat we’d like to achieve in the future. What we need, then, is not a peaceful\nexistence, but a challenge we can strive to meet by applying all the skills at our\ndisposal.\nExistential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which\npeople do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want\nto do. They often try to fill the gap between what is expected of them and what\nthey want for themselves with economic power or physical pleasure, or by\nnumbing their senses. It can even lead to suicide.\nSunday neurosis, for example, is what happens when, without the obligations\nand commitments of the workweek, the individual realizes how empty he is\ninside. He has to find a solution. Above all, he has to find his purpose, his reason\nfor getting out of bed—his ikigai.\n“I Feel Empty Inside”\nIn a study conducted at the Vienna Polyclinic Hospital, Frankl’s team\nfound that 55 percent of the patients they interviewed were experiencing\nsome degree of existential crisis.4\nAccording to logotherapy, discovering one’s purpose in life helps an individual\nfill that existential void. Frankl, a man who faced his problems and turned his\nobjectives into actions, could look back on his life in peace as he grew old. Hedid not have to envy those still enjoying their youth, because he had amassed a\nbroad set of experiences that showed he had lived for something.\nBetter living through logotherapy: A few key ideas\nWe don’t create the meaning of our life, as Sartre claimed—we discover it.\nWe each have a unique reason for being, which can be adjusted or\ntransformed many times over the years.\nJust as worry often brings about precisely the thing that was feared,\nexcessive attention to a desire (or “hyper-intention”) can keep that desire\nfrom being fulfilled.\nHumor can help break negative cycles and reduce anxiety.\nWe all have the capacity to do noble or terrible things. The side of the\nequation we end up on depends on our decisions, not on the condition in\nwhich we find ourselves.\nIn the pages that follow, we will look at four cases from Frankl’s own practice\nin order to better understand the search for meaning and purpose.\nCase study: Viktor Frankl\nIn German concentration camps, as in those that would later be built in Japan and\nKorea, psychiatrists confirmed that the prisoners with the greatest chance of\nsurvival were those who had things they wanted to accomplish outside the camp,\nthose who felt a strong need to get out of there alive. This was true of Frankl,\nwho, after being released and successfully developing the school of logotherapy,\nrealized he had been the first patient of his own practice.\nFrankl had a goal to achieve, and it made him persevere. He arrived at\nAuschwitz carrying a manuscript that contained all the theories and research he\nhad compiled over the course of his career, ready for publication. When it was\nconfiscated, he felt compelled to write it all over again, and that need drove him\nand gave his life meaning amid the constant horror and doubt of the\nconcentration camp—so much so that over the years, and especially when he fell\nill with typhus, he would jot down fragments and key words from the lost work\non any scrap of paper he found.Case study: The American diplomat\nAn important North American diplomat went to Frankl to pick up where he left\noff with a course of treatment he had started five years earlier in the United\nStates. When Frankl asked him why he’d started therapy in the first place, the\ndiplomat answered that he hated his job and his country’s international policies,\nwhich he had to follow and enforce. His American psychoanalyst, whom he’d\nbeen seeing for years, insisted he make peace with his father so that his\ngovernment and his job, both representations of the paternal figure, would seem\nless disagreeable. Frankl, however, showed him in just a few sessions that his\nfrustration was due to the fact that he wanted to pursue a different career, and the\ndiplomat concluded his treatment with that idea in mind.\nFive years later, the former diplomat informed Frankl that he had been\nworking during that time in a different profession, and that he was happy.\nIn Frankl’s view, the man not only didn’t need all those years of\npsychoanalysis, he also couldn’t even really be considered a “patient” in need of\ntherapy. He was simply someone in search of a new life’s purpose; as soon as he\nfound it, his life took on deeper meaning.\nCase study: The suicidal mother\nThe mother of a boy who had died at age eleven was admitted to Frankl’s clinic\nafter she tried to kill herself and her other son. It was this other son, paralyzed\nsince birth, who kept her from carrying out her plan: He did believe his life had a\npurpose, and if his mother killed them both, it would keep him from achieving\nhis goals.\nThe woman shared her story in a group session. To help her, Frankl asked\nanother woman to imagine a hypothetical situation in which she lay on her\ndeathbed, old and wealthy but childless. The woman insisted that, in that case, she\nwould have felt her life had been a failure.\nWhen the suicidal mother was asked to perform the same exercise, imagining\nherself on her deathbed, she looked back and realized that she had done\neverything in her power for her children—for both of them. She had given her\nparalyzed son a good life, and he had turned into a kind, reasonably happy person.\nTo this she added, crying, “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life;\nfor I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to live it fully; I\nhave done my best—I have done my best for my son. My life was no failure!”have done my best—I have done my best for my son. My life was no failure!”\nIn this way, by imagining herself on her deathbed and looking back, the\nsuicidal mother found the meaning that, though she was not aware of it, her life\nalready had.\nCase study: The grief-stricken doctor\nAn elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen\nafter the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help.\nInstead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him\nwhat would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor,\nhorrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she\nwould have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see,\ndoctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for\nthis is to survive, and mourn her.”\nThe doctor didn’t say another word. He left Frankl’s office in peace, after\ntaking the therapist’s hand in his own. He was able to tolerate the pain in place of\nhis beloved wife. His life had been given a purpose.\nMorita therapy\nIn the same decade that logotherapy came into being—a few years earlier, in fact\n—Shoma Morita created his own purpose-centered therapy, in Japan. It proved to\nbe effective in the treatment of neurosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and\nposttraumatic stress.\nIn addition to being a psychotherapist, Shoma Morita was a Zen Buddhist, and\nhis therapy left a lasting spiritual mark on Japan.\nMany Western forms of therapy focus on controlling or modifying the\npatient’s emotions. In the West, we tend to believe that what we think influences\nhow we feel, which in turn influences how we act. In contrast, Morita therapy\nfocuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them,\nsince their feelings will change as a result of their actions.\nIn addition to accepting the patient’s emotions, Morita therapy seeks to\n“create” new emotions on the basis of actions. According to Morita, these\nemotions are learned through experience and repetition.Morita therapy is not meant to eliminate symptoms; instead it teaches us to\naccept our desires, anxieties, fears, and worries, and let them go. As Morita\nwrites in his book Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based\nDisorders, “In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.”\nMorita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the following\nfable: A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post\nin an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the\npost. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more\ntrapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and\ndiscomfort.5\nThe basic principles of Morita therapy\n1. Accept your feelings. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to\ncontrol them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense. Regarding\nhuman emotions, the Zen master would say, “If we try to get rid of one wave with\nanother, we end up with an infinite sea.” We don’t create our feelings; they\nsimply come to us, and we have to accept them. The trick is welcoming them.\nMorita likened emotions to the weather: We can’t predict or control them; we can\nonly observe them. To this point, he often quoted the Vietnamese monk Thich\nNhat Hanh, who would say, “Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with\nme, and I will care for you.”6\n2. Do what you should be doing. We shouldn’t focus on eliminating symptoms,\nbecause recovery will come on its own. We should focus instead on the present\nmoment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we\nshould avoid intellectualizing the situation. The therapist’s mission is to develop\nthe patient’s character so he or she can face any situation, and character is\ngrounded in the things we do. Morita therapy does not offer its patients\nexplanations, but rather allows them to learn from their actions and activities. It\ndoesn’t tell you how to meditate, or how to keep a diary the way Western\ntherapies do. It is up to the patient to make discoveries through experience.\n3. Discover your life’s purpose. We can’t control our emotions, but we can take\ncharge of our actions every day. This is why we should have a clear sense of our\npurpose, and always keep Morita’s mantra in mind: “What do we need to be doing\nright now? What action should we be taking?” The key to achieving this is having\ndared to look inside yourself to find your ikigai.The four phases of Morita therapy\nMorita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the\nfollowing stages:\n1. Isolation and rest (five to seven days). During the first week of treatment,\nthe patient rests in a room without any external stimuli. No television, books,\nfamily, friends, or speaking. All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for\nmost of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who tries to avoid\ninteracting with him as much as possible. The therapist simply advises the patient\nto continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as he lies there. When the\npatient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to\nthe next stage of therapy.\n2. Light occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient\nperforms repetitive tasks in silence. One of these is keeping a diary about his\nthoughts and feelings. The patient goes outside after a week of being shut in,\ntakes walks in nature, and does breathing exercises. He also starts doing simple\nactivities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During this stage, the patient is\nstill not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist.\n3. Occupational therapy (five to seven days). In this stage, the patient performs\ntasks that require physical movement. Dr. Morita liked to take his patients to the\nmountains to chop wood. In addition to physical tasks, the patient is also\nimmersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The\npatient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand.\n4. The return to social life and the “real” world. The patient leaves the hospital\nand is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and\noccupational therapy developed during treatment. The idea is to reenter society as\na new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or\nemotional pressures.\nNaikan meditation\nMorita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much of his\ntherapy draws on his knowledge and mastery of this school, which centers on\nthree questions the individual must ask him-or herself:1. What have I received from person X?\n2. What have I given to person X?\n3. What problems have I caused person X?\nThrough these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our\nproblems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. As Morita said, “If you are\nangry and want to fight, think about it for three days before coming to blows.\nAfter three days, the intense desire to fight will pass on its own.”7\nAnd now, ikigai\nLogotherapy and Morita therapy are both grounded in a personal, unique\nexperience that you can access without therapists or spiritual retreats: the mission\nof finding your ikigai, your existential fuel. Once you find it, it is only a matter of\nhaving the courage and making the effort to stay on the right path.\nIn the following chapters, we’ll take a look at the basic tools you’ll need to get\nmoving along that path: finding flow in the tasks you’ve chosen to do, eating in a\nbalanced and mindful way, doing low-intensity exercise, and learning not to give\nin when difficulties arise. In order to do this, you have to accept that the world—\nlike the people who live in it—is imperfect, but that it is still full of opportunities\nfor growth and achievement.\nAre you ready to throw yourself into your passion as if it were the most\nimportant thing in the world?IV\nFIND FLOW IN EVERYTHING YOU DO\nHow to turn work and free time\ninto spaces for growthWe are what we repeatedly do.\nExcellence, then, is not an act but a habit.\n—Aristotle\nGoing with the flow\nImagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up\non both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect.\nYou are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how\nto move at each moment. There is no future, no past. There is only the present.\nYou feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a\nsingle entity. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or\ndistracted by anything else. Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you\nare doing.\nThis is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water,\nmy friend.”\nWe’ve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity\nwe enjoy. We start cooking and before we know it, several hours have passed.\nWe spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we\nnotice the sunset and realize we haven’t eaten dinner. We go surfing and don’t\nrealize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our\nmuscles ache.\nThe opposite can also happen. When we have to complete a task we don’t want\nto do, every minute feels like a lifetime and we can’t stop looking at our watch.\nAs the quip attributed to Einstein goes, “Put your hand on a hot stove for a\nminute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems\nlike a minute. That is relativity.”\nThe funny thing is that someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we\nwant to finish as quickly as possible.\nWhat makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever\nworries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions\ncan help us discover our ikigai.The power of flow\nThese questions are also at the heart of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s\nresearch into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing.\nCsikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight,\ncreativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life.\nThere is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your\nikigai, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through\nthis state, to have an “optimal experience.”\nIn order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the\ntime we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing\nourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating\ntoo much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front\nof the TV.\nAs Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal\nExperience, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that\nnothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will\ndo it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”\nIt is not only creative professionals who require the high doses of\nconcentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also\nspend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state.\nAccording to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way\nupon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a\nsurgeon performing an operation. A professor of psychology, Csikszentmihalyi\nanalyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same\namong individuals of all ages and cultures. In New York and Okinawa, we all\nreach a state of flow in the same way.\nBut what happens to our mind when we are in that state?\nWhen we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions.\nOur mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while\nour mind is on other things.\nIf you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you\nconsider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your\nchances of achieving flow.\nThe Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow\nAccording to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, theAccording to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the\nrequirements for achieving flow are:\n1. Knowing what to do\n2. Knowing how to do it\n3. Knowing how well you are doing\n4. Knowing where to go (where navigation is involved)\n5. Perceiving significant challenges\n6. Perceiving significant skills\n7. Being free from distractions1\nStrategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too\ndifficult!)\nSchaffer’s model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of\ncompleting but that are slightly outside our comfort zone.\nEvery task, sport, or job has a set of rules, and we need a set of skills to follow\nthem. If the rules for completing a task or achieving a purpose are too basic\nrelative to our skill set, we will likely get bored. Activities that are too easy lead\nto apathy.\nIf, on the other hand, we assign ourselves a task that is too difficult, we won’t\nhave the skills to complete it and will almost certainly give up—and feel\nfrustrated, to boot.\nThe ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just\na bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. This is what Ernest\nHemingway meant when he said, “Sometimes I write better than I can.”2\nWe want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of\npushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be\nable to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult\nachievement.”3\nIf you’re a graphic designer, learn a new software program for your next\nproject. If you’re a programmer, use a new programming language. If you’re a\ndancer, try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed\nimpossible for years.\nAdd a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort\nzone.zone.\nEven doing something as simple as reading means following certain rules,\nhaving certain abilities and knowledge. If we set out to read a book on quantum\nmechanics for specialists in physics without being specialists in physics ourselves,\nwe’ll probably give up after a few minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, if\nwe already know everything a book has to tell us, we’ll get bored right away.\nHowever, if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds\non what we already know, we’ll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will\nflow. This pleasure and satisfaction are evidence that we are in tune with our\nikigai.\nEasy Challenging Beyond Our Abilities\nBoredom Flow Anxiety\nStrategy 2: Have a clear, concrete objective\nVideo games—played in moderation—board games, and sports are great ways to\nachieve flow, because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival or your\nown record while following a set of explicitly defined rules.\nUnfortunately, the objective isn’t quite as clear in most situations.\nAccording to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when asked about their\nbosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is\nthat they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the\nemployees don’t know what their objectives are.\nWhat often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost\nin the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they\ndon’t have a clear objective. It’s like heading out to sea with a map but no\ndestination.\nIt is much more important to have a compass pointing to a concrete objective\nthan to have a map. Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, encourages us to use\nthe principle of “compass over maps” as a tool to navigate our world of\nuncertainty. In the book Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future, he and Jeff\nHowe write, “In an increasingly unpredictable world moving ever more quickly, a\ndetailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A\ngood compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. It doesn’t\nmean that you should start your journey without any idea where you’re going.What it does mean is understanding that while the path to your goal may not be\nstraight, you’ll finish faster and more efficiently than you would have if you had\ntrudged along a preplanned route.”\nIn business, the creative professions, and education alike, it’s important to\nreflect on what we hope to achieve before starting to work, study, or make\nsomething. We should ask ourselves questions such as:\nWhat is my objective for today’s session in the studio?\nHow many words am I going to write today for the article coming out next\nmonth?\nWhat is my team’s mission?\nHow fast will I set the metronome tomorrow in order to play that sonata at\nan allegro tempo by the end of the week?\nHaving a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to\nknow how to leave it behind when we get down to business. Once the journey has\nbegun, we should keep this objective in mind without obsessing over it.\nWhen Olympic athletes compete for a gold medal, they can’t stop to think how\npretty the medal is. They have to be present in the moment—they have to flow. If\nthey lose focus for a second, thinking how proud they’ll be to show the medal to\ntheir parents, they’ll almost certainly commit an error at a critical moment and\nwill not win the competition.\nOne common example of this is writer’s block. Imagine that a writer has to\nfinish a novel in three months. The objective is clear; the problem is that the\nwriter can’t stop obsessing over it. Every day she wakes up thinking, “I have to\nwrite that novel,” and every day she sets about reading the newspaper and\ncleaning the house. Every evening she feels frustrated and promises she’ll get to\nwork the next day.\nDays, weeks, and months pass, and the writer still hasn’t gotten anything down\non the page, when all it would have taken was to sit down and get that first word\nout, then the second . . . to flow with the project, expressing her ikigai.\nAs soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you\nwill achieve a pleasant flow in the activity you’re doing. Getting back to Albert\nEinstein, “a happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.”4\nClearly Defined Objective and a Obsessive Desire to Achieve a Goal\nVague Objective\nFocus on Process While Ignoring Process\nConfusion; time and energy wasted on Fixation on the objective rather than gettingConfusion; time and energy wasted on Fixation on the objective rather than getting\nFlow\nmeaningless tasks down to business\nMental block Flow Mental block\nStrategy 3: Concentrate on a single task\nThis is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles we face today, with so much\ntechnology and so many distractions. We’re listening to a video on YouTube\nwhile writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt pops up and we answer it.\nThen our smartphone vibrates in our pocket; just as soon as we respond to that\nmessage, we’re back at our computer, logging on to Facebook.\nPretty soon thirty minutes have passed, and we’ve forgotten what the e-mail\nwe were writing was supposed to be about.\nThis also happens sometimes when we put on a movie with dinner and don’t\nrealize how delicious the salmon was until we’re taking the last bite.\nWe often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence\nshows that it has the opposite effect. Even those who claim to be good at\nmultitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least\nproductive people.\nOur brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually\nprocess a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re\nreally doing is switching back and forth between tasks very quickly.\nUnfortunately, we’re not computers adept at parallel processing. We end up\nspending all our energy alternating between tasks, instead of focusing on doing\none of them well.\nConcentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in\nachieving flow.\nAccording to Csikszentmihalyi, in order to focus on a task we need:\n1. To be in a distraction-free environment\n2. To have control over what we are doing at every moment\nTechnology is great, if we’re in control of it. It’s not so great if it takes control\nof us. For example, if you have to write a research paper, you might sit down at\nyour computer and use Google to look up the information you need. However, if\nyou’re not very disciplined, you might end up surfing the Web instead of writing\nthat paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling youthat paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling you\nout of your state of flow.\nIt has been scientifically shown that if we continually ask our brains to switch\nback and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and\nremember less of what we’ve done.\nSeveral studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass\ndescribe our generation as suffering from an epidemic of multitasking. One such\nstudy analyzed the behavior of hundreds of students, dividing them into groups\nbased on the number of things they tended to do at once. The students who were\nthe most addicted to multitasking typically alternated among more than four\ntasks; for example, taking notes while reading a textbook, listening to a podcast,\nanswering messages on their smartphone, and sometimes checking their Twitter\ntimeline.\nEach group of students was shown a screen with several red and several blue\narrows. The objective of the exercise was to count the red arrows.\nAt first, all the students answered correctly right away, without much trouble.\nAs the number of blue arrows increased (the number of red arrows stayed the\nsame; only their position changed), however, the students accustomed to\nmultitasking had serious trouble counting the red arrows in the time allotted, or as\nquickly as the students who did not habitually multitask, for one very simple\nreason: They got distracted by the blue arrows! Their brains were trained to pay\nattention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the\nother students were trained to focus on a single task—in this case, counting the\nred arrows and ignoring the blue ones.5\nOther studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our\nproductivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points.\nOne study funded by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social\nResearch found that a sample group of more than four thousand young adults\nbetween the ages of twenty and twenty-four who were addicted to their\nsmartphones got less sleep, felt less connected to their community at school, and\nwere more likely to show signs of depression.6\nConcentrating on a Single Task Multitasking\nMakes achieving flow more likely Makes achieving flow impossible\nIncreases productivity Decreases productivity by 60 percent (though it doesn’t seem to)\nIncreases our power of retention Makes it harder to remember things\nMakes us less likely to make mistakes Makes us more likely to make mistakes\nHelps us feel calm and in control of the task atHelps us feel calm and in control of the task at Makes us feel stressed by the sensation that we’re losing control, that our\nhand tasks are controlling us\nCauses us to become more considerate as we Causes us to hurt those around us through our “addiction” to stimuli:\npay full attention to those around us always checking our phones, always on social media . . .\nIncreases creativity Reduces creativity\nWhat can we do to avoid falling victim to this flow-impeding epidemic? How\ncan we train our brains to focus on a single task? Here are a few ideas for\ncreating a space and time free of distractions, to increase our chances of reaching\na state of flow and thereby getting in touch with our ikigai:\nDon’t look at any kind of screen for the first hour you’re awake and the last\nhour before you go to sleep.\nTurn off your phone before you achieve flow. There is nothing more\nimportant than the task you have chosen to do during this time. If this seems\ntoo extreme, enable the “do not disturb” function so only the people closest\nto you can contact you in case of emergency.\nDesignate one day of the week, perhaps a Saturday or Sunday, a day of\ntechnological “fasting,” making exceptions only for e-readers (without Wi-\nFi) or MP3 players.\nGo to a café that doesn’t have Wi-Fi.\nRead and respond to e-mail only once or twice per day. Define those times\nclearly and stick to them.\nTry the Pomodoro Technique: Get yourself a kitchen timer (some are made\nto look like a pomodoro, or tomato) and commit to working on a single task\nas long as it’s running. The Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of\nwork and 5 minutes of rest for each cycle, but you can also do 50 minutes of\nwork and 10 minutes of rest. Find the pace that’s best for you; the most\nimportant thing is to be disciplined in completing each cycle.\nStart your work session with a ritual you enjoy and end it with a reward.\nTrain your mind to return to the present when you find yourself getting\ndistracted. Practice mindfulness or another form of meditation, go for a\nwalk or a swim—whatever will help you get centered again.\nWork in a space where you will not be distracted. If you can’t do this at\nhome, go to a library, a café, or, if your task involves playing the saxophone,\na music studio. If you find that your surroundings continue to distract you,\nkeep looking until you find the right place.Divide each activity into groups of related tasks, and assign each group its\nown place and time. For example, if you’re writing a magazine article, you\ncould do research and take notes at home in the morning, write in the library\nin the afternoon, and edit on the couch at night.\nBundle routine tasks—such as sending out invoices, making phone calls, and\nso on—and do them all at once.\nAdvantages of Flow Disadvantages of Distraction\nA focused mind A wandering mind\nLiving in the present Thinking about the past and the future\nConcerns about our daily life and the people around us\nWe are free from worry\ninvade our thoughts\nThe hours fly by Every minute seems endless\nWe lose control and fail to complete the task at hand, or\nWe feel in control\nother tasks or people keep us from our work\nWe prepare thoroughly We act without being prepared\nWe know what we should be doing at any given moment We frequently get stuck and don’t know how to proceed\nOur mind is clear and overcomes all obstacles to the flow of\nWe are plagued by doubts, concerns, and low self-esteem\nthought\nIt’s pleasant It’s boring and exhausting\nOur ego fades: We are not the ones controlling the activity or Constant self-criticism: Our ego is present and we feel\ntask we’re doing—the task is leading us frustrated\nFlow in Japan: Takumis, engineers, geniuses, and otakus\nWhat do takumis (artisans), engineers, inventors, and otakus (fans of anime and\nmanga) have in common? They all understand the importance of flowing with\ntheir ikigai at all times.\nOne widespread stereotype about people in Japan is that they’re exceptionally\ndedicated and hardworking, even though some Japanese people say they look like\nthey’re working harder than they really are. There is no doubt, though, about their\nability to be completely absorbed in a task, or about their perseverance when\nthere is a problem to be solved. One of the first words one learns when starting\nJapanese lessons is ganbaru, which means “to persevere” or “to stay firm by doing\none’s best.”Japanese people often apply themselves to even the most basic tasks with an\nintensity that borders on obsession. We see this in all kinds of contexts, from the\n“retirees” taking meticulous care of their rice fields in the mountains of Nagano\nto the college students working the weekend shift in convenience stores known as\nkonbinis. If you go to Japan, you’ll experience this attention to detail firsthand in\nalmost every transaction.\nWalk into one of the stores that sell handcrafted objects in Naha, Kanazawa,\nor Kyoto and you’ll also discover that Japan is a treasure trove of traditional\ncraftwork. The people of Japan have a unique talent for creating new\ntechnologies while preserving artisanal traditions and techniques.\nThe art of the takumi\nToyota employs “artisans” who are able to make a certain type of screw by hand.\nThese takumi, or experts in a particular manual skill, are extremely important to\nToyota, and they are hard to replace. Some of them are the only people who\nknow how to perform their exact skill, and it doesn’t seem as though a new\ngeneration is going to take up the mantle.\nTurntable needles are another example: They’re produced almost exclusively\nin Japan, where you can find the last remaining people who know how to use the\nmachinery required to make these precision needles, and who are trying to pass\non their knowledge to their descendants.\nWe met a takumi on a visit to Kumano, a small town near Hiroshima. We were\nthere for the day, working on a photo essay for one of the most famous brands of\nmakeup brushes in the West. The billboard welcoming visitors to Kumano shows\na mascot holding a large brush. In addition to the brush factories, the town is full\nof little houses and vegetable gardens; heading farther in, you can see several\nShinto shrines at the base of the mountains that surround the town.\nWe spent hours taking photos in factories full of people in orderly rows, each\ndoing a single task—such as painting the handles of the brushes or loading boxes\nof them onto trucks—before we realized we still hadn’t seen anyone actually\nputting bristles into the brush heads.\nAfter we asked about this and got the runaround several times, the president\nof one company agreed to show us how it was done. He led us out of the building\nand asked us to get into his car. After a five-minute drive we parked next to\nanother, smaller structure and climbed the stairs. He opened a door and we\nwalked into a small room filled with windows that let in lovely natural light.walked into a small room filled with windows that let in lovely natural light.\nIn the middle of the room was a woman wearing a mask. You could see only\nher eyes. She was so focused on choosing individual bristles for the brushes—\ngracefully moving her hands and fingers, using scissors and combs to sort the\nbristles—that she didn’t even notice our presence. Her movements were so quick\nit was hard to tell what she was doing.\nThe president of the company interrupted her to let her know that we’d be\ntaking photos as she worked. We couldn’t see her mouth, but the glint in her eye\nand the cheerful inflection in her speech let us know she was smiling. She looked\nhappy and proud talking about her work and responsibilities.\nWe had to use extremely fast shutter speeds to capture her movements. Her\nhands danced and flowed in concert with her tools and the bristles she was\nsorting.\nThe president told us that this takumi was one of the most important people in\nthe company, even though she was hidden away in a separate building. Every\nbristle of every brush the company made passed through her hands.\nSteve Jobs in Japan\nApple cofounder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Japan. Not only did he visit the Sony\nfactories in the 1980s and adopt many of their methods when he founded Apple,\nhe was also captivated by the simplicity and quality of Japanese porcelain in\nKyoto.\nIt was not, however, an artisan from Kyoto who won Steve Jobs’s devotion, but\nrather a takumi from Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga, who used a technique\ncalled Etchu Seto-yaki, known by only a few.\nOn a visit to Kyoto, Jobs heard of an exhibition of Shakunaga’s work. He\nimmediately understood that there was something special about Shakunaga’s\nporcelain. As a matter of fact, he bought several cups, vases, and plates, and went\nback to the show three times that week.\nJobs returned to Kyoto several times over the course of his life in search of\ninspiration, and ended up meeting Shakunaga in person. It is said that Jobs had\nmany questions for him—almost all of them about the fabrication process and the\ntype of porcelain he used.\nShakunaga explained that he used white porcelain he extracted himself from\nmountains in the Toyama prefecture, making him the only artist of his ilkfamiliar with the fabrication process of porcelain objects from their origins in the\nmountains to their final form—an authentic takumi.\nJobs was so impressed that he considered going to Toyama to see the mountain\nwhere Shakunaga got his porcelain, but thought better of it when he heard that it\nwas more than four hours by train from Kyoto.\nIn an interview after Jobs’s death, Shakunaga said he was very proud that his\nwork had been appreciated by the man who created the iPhone. He added that\nJobs’s last purchase from him had been a set of twelve teacups. Jobs had asked\nfor something special, “a new style.” To satisfy this request, Shakunaga made 150\nteacups in the process of testing out new ideas. Of these, he chose the twelve best\nand sent them to the Jobs family.\nEver since his first trip to Japan, Jobs was fascinated and inspired by the\ncountry’s artisans, engineers (especially at Sony), philosophy (especially Zen), and\ncuisine (especially sushi).7\nSophisticated simplicity\nWhat do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in\ncommon? Simplicity and attention to detail. It is not a lazy simplicity but a\nsophisticated one that searches out new frontiers, always taking the object, the\nbody and mind, or the cuisine to the next level, according to one’s ikigai.\nAs Csikszentmihalyi would say, the key is always having a meaningful\nchallenge to overcome in order to maintain flow.\nThe documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi gives us another example of a takumi,\nthis time in the kitchen. Its protagonist has been making sushi every day for more\nthan eighty years, and owns a small sushi restaurant near the Ginza subway station\nin Tokyo. He and his son go every day to the famous Tsukiji fish market and\nchoose the best fish to bring back to the restaurant.\nIn the documentary, we see one of Jiro’s apprentices learning to make tamago\n(a thin, slightly sweet omelet). No matter how hard he tries, he can’t get Jiro’s\napproval. He keeps practicing for years until he finally does.\nWhy does the apprentice refuse to give up? Doesn’t he get bored cooking eggs\nevery day? No, because making sushi is his ikigai, too.\nBoth Jiro and his son are culinary artists. They don’t get bored when they cook\n—they achieve a state of flow. They enjoy themselves completely when they arein the kitchen; that is their happiness, their ikigai. They’ve learned to take\npleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time.\nBeyond the close relationship between father and son, which helps them keep\nthe challenge going each day, they also work in a quiet, peaceful environment that\nallows them to concentrate. Even after receiving a three-star rating from\nMichelin, they never considered opening other locations or expanding the\nbusiness. They serve just ten patrons at a time at the bar of their small restaurant.\nJiro’s family isn’t looking to make money; instead they value good working\nconditions and creating an environment in which they can flow while making the\nbest sushi in the world.\nJiro, like Yukio Shakunaga, begins his work at “the source.” He goes to the\nfish market to find the best tuna; Shakunaga goes to the mountains to find the\nbest porcelain. When they get down to work, both become one with the object\nthey are creating. This unity with the object that they reach in a state of flow\ntakes on special meaning in Japan, where, according to Shintoism, forests, trees,\nand objects have a kami (spirit or god) within them.\nWhen someone—whether an artist, an engineer, or a chef—sets out to create\nsomething, his or her responsibility is to use nature to give it “life” while\nrespecting that nature at every moment. During this process, the artisan becomes\none with the object and flows with it. An ironworker would say that metal has a\nlife of its own, just as someone making ceramics would say that the clay does.\nThe Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology together: not man\nversus nature, but rather a union of the two.\nThe purity of Ghibli\nThere are those who say that the Shinto value of being connected with nature is\nvanishing. One of the harshest critics of this loss is another artist with a clearly\ndefined ikigai: Hayao Miyazaki, the director of the animated films produced by\nStudio Ghibli.\nIn nearly all his films we see humans, technology, fantasy, and nature in a state\nof conflict—and, in the end, coming together. One of the most poignant\nmetaphors in his film Spirited Away is an obese spirit covered in trash that\nrepresents the pollution of the rivers.\nIn Miyazaki’s films, forests have personalities, trees have feelings, and robots\nbefriend birds. Considered a national treasure by the Japanese government,Miyazaki is an artist capable of becoming completely absorbed in his art. He uses\na cell phone from the late 1990s, and he makes his entire team draw by hand. He\n“directs” his films by rendering on paper even the tiniest detail, achieving flow by\ndrawing, not by using a computer. Thanks to this obsession on the director’s part,\nStudio Ghibli is one of the only studios in the world where almost the entire\nproduction process is carried out using traditional techniques.\nThose who have visited Studio Ghibli know that it is fairly typical, on a given\nSunday to see a solitary individual tucked away in a corner, hard at work—a man\nin simple clothes who will greet them with an ohayo (hello) without looking up.\nMiyazaki is so passionate about his work that he spends many Sundays in the\nstudio, enjoying the state of flow, putting his ikigai above all else. Visitors know\nthat under no circumstances is one to bother Miyazaki, who is known for his\nquick temper—especially if he is interrupted while drawing.\nIn 2013, Miyazaki announced he was going to retire. To commemorate his\nretirement, the television station NHK made a documentary showing him in his\nlast days at work. He is drawing in nearly every scene of the film. In one scene,\nseveral of his colleagues are seen coming out of a meeting, and there he is,\ndrawing in a corner, paying no attention to them. In another scene, he is shown\nwalking to work on December 30 (a national holiday in Japan) and opening the\ndoors of Studio Ghibli so he can spend the day there, drawing alone.\nMiyazaki can’t stop drawing. The day after his “retirement,” instead of going\non vacation or staying at home, he went to Studio Ghibli and sat down to draw.\nHis colleagues put on their best poker faces, not knowing what to say. One year\nlater, he announced he wouldn’t make any more feature films but that he would\nkeep on drawing until the day he died.\nCan someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does?\nThe recluses\nIt is not only the Japanese who have this capacity; there are artists and scientists\nall over the world with strong, clear ikigais. They do what they love until their\ndying day.\nThe last thing Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula\nthat attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. When he\ndied, he was still doing what he loved. If he hadn’t been a physicist, he said, he\nwould have been happy as a musician. When he wasn’t focused on physics ormathematics, he enjoyed playing the violin. Reaching a state of flow while\nworking on his formulas or playing music, his two ikigais, brought him endless\npleasure.\nMany such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are\nreally doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, sometimes at the\nexpense of other aspects of their lives. They are outliers who apply the principles\nof flow to their lives to an extreme.\nAnother example of this kind of artist is the novelist Haruki Murakami. He\nsees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every\nfew years.\nArtists know how important it is to protect their space, control their\nenvironment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai.\nMicroflow: Enjoying mundane tasks\nBut what happens when we have to, say, do the laundry, mow the lawn, or attend\nto paperwork? Is there a way to make these mundane tasks enjoyable?\nNear the Shinjuku subway station, in one of the neural centers of Tokyo, there\nis a supermarket that still employs elevator operators. The elevators are fairly\nstandard and could easily be operated by the customers, but the store prefers to\nprovide the service of someone holding the door open for you, pushing the button\nfor your floor, and bowing as you exit.\nIf you ask around, you’ll learn that there is one elevator operator who has been\ndoing the same job since 2004. She is always smiling and enthusiastic about her\nwork. How is she able to enjoy such a job? Doesn’t she get bored doing\nsomething so repetitive?\nOn closer inspection, it becomes clear that the elevator operator is not just\npushing buttons but is instead performing a whole sequence of movements. She\nbegins by greeting the customers with a songlike salutation followed by a bow and\na welcoming wave of the hand. Then she presses the elevator button with a\ngraceful movement, as though she is a geisha offering a client a cup of tea.\nCsikszentmihalyi calls this microflow.\nWe’ve all been bored in a class or at a conference and started doodling to keep\nourselves entertained. Or whistled while painting a wall. If we’re not truly being\nchallenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. Our\nability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy,\nis key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.\nEven Bill Gates washes the dishes every night. He says he enjoys it—that it\nhelps him relax and clear his mind, and that he tries to do it a little better each\nday, following an established order or set of rules he’s made for himself: plates\nfirst, forks second, and so on.\nIt’s one of his daily moments of microflow.\nRichard Feynman, one of the most important physicists of all time, also took\npleasure in routine tasks. W. Daniel Hillis, one of the founders of the\nsupercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines, hired Feynman to work on the\ndevelopment of a computer that could handle parallel processing when he was\nalready world famous. He says Feynman showed up on his first day of work and\nsaid, “OK, boss, what’s my assignment?” They didn’t have anything prepared, so\nthey asked him to work on a certain mathematical problem. He immediately\nrealized they were giving him an irrelevant task to keep him busy and said, “That\nsounds like a bunch of baloney—give me something real to do.”\nSo they sent him to a nearby shop to buy office supplies, and he completed his\nassignment with a smile on his face. When he didn’t have something important to\ndo or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowing—say,\npainting the office walls.\nWeeks later, after visiting the Thinking Machines offices a group of investors\ndeclared, “You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering\ncircuits.”8\nInstant vacations: Getting there through meditation\nTraining the mind can get us to a place of flow more quickly. Meditation is one\nway to exercise our mental muscles.\nThere are many types of meditation, but they all have the same objective:\ncalming the mind, observing our thoughts and emotions, and centering our focus\non a single object.\nThe basic practice involves sitting with a straight back and focusing on your\nbreath. Anyone can do it, and you feel a difference after just one session. By\nfixing your attention on the air moving in and out of your nose, you can slow the\ntorrent of thoughts and clear your mental horizons.\nThe Archer’s SecretThe winner of the 1988 Olympic gold medal for archery was a seventeen-\nyear-old woman from South Korea. When asked how she prepared, she\nreplied that the most important part of her training was meditating for two\nhours each day.\nIf we want to get better at reaching a state of flow, meditation is an excellent\nantidote to our smartphones and their notifications constantly clamoring for our\nattention.\nOne of the most common mistakes among people starting to meditate is\nworrying about doing it “right,” achieving absolute mental silence, or reaching\n“nirvana.” The most important thing is to focus on the journey.\nSince the mind is a constant swirl of thoughts, ideas, and emotions, slowing\ndown the “centrifuge”—even for just a few seconds—can help us feel more\nrested and leave us with a sense of clarity.\nIn fact, one of the things we learn in the practice of meditation is not to worry\nabout anything that flits across our mental screen. The idea of killing our boss\nmight flash into our mind, but we simply label it as a thought and let it pass like a\ncloud, without judging or rejecting it. It is only a thought—one of the sixty\nthousand we have every day, according to some experts.\nMeditation generates alpha and theta brain waves. For those experienced in\nmeditation, these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a\nbeginner to experience them. These relaxing brain waves are the ones that are\nactivated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a\nhot bath.\nWe all carry a spa with us everywhere we go. It’s just a matter of knowing how\nto get in—something anyone can do, with a bit of practice.\nHumans as ritualistic beings\nLife is inherently ritualistic. We could argue that humans naturally follow rituals\nthat keep us busy. In some modern cultures, we have been forced out of our\nritualistic lives to pursue goal after goal in order to be seen as successful. But\nthroughout history, humans have always been busy. We were hunting, cooking,\nfarming, exploring, and raising families—activities that were structured as rituals\nto keep us busy throughout our days.\nBut in an unusual way, rituals still permeate daily life and business practices inBut in an unusual way, rituals still permeate daily life and business practices in\nmodern Japan. The main religions in Japan—Confucianism, Buddhism, and\nShintoism—are all ones in which the rituals are more important than absolute\nrules.\nWhen doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on\nsomething is more important than the final results. Whether this is good or bad\nfor the economy is beyond the scope of this book. What is indisputable, though,\nis that finding flow in a “ritualistic workplace” is much easier than in one in\nwhich we are continually stressed out trying to achieve unclear goals set by our\nbosses.\nRituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow.\nWhen we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed\nby it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the substeps, on the path to\nachieving a goal. When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts\nand then attack each part one by one.\nFocus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of\nflow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the\ndoing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.”\nThe happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones\nwho spend more time than others in a state of flow.\nUsing flow to find your ikigai\nAfter reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in\nyour life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask\nyourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in\ncommon? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the\nactivities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people?\nDo you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just\nto think?\nIn the answers to these questions you might find the underlying ikigai that\ndrives your life. If you don’t, then keep searching by going deeper into what you\nlike by spending more of your time in the activities that make you flow. Also, try\nnew things that are not on the list of what makes you flow but that are similar and\nthat you are curious about. For example, if photography is something that drives\nyou into flow, you could also try painting; you might even like it more! Or if you\nlove snowboarding and have never tried surfing . . .Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will\nflow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai.V\nMASTERS OF LONGEVITY\nWords of wisdom from the\nlongest-living people in the worldworking on this book, we didn’t want to just research the factors that contribute to a long and\nWHEN WE STARTED\nhappy life; we wanted to hear from the true masters of this art.\nThe interviews we conducted in Okinawa merit their own chapter, but in the\nsection that precedes it we have provided an overview of the life philosophies of\na few international champions of longevity. We’re talking about\nsupercentenarians—people who live to 110 years of age or more.\nThe term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness\nBook of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it\nappeared in William Strauss and Neil Howe’s Generations. Today there are an\nestimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only\naround 75 of them has been confirmed. They aren’t superheroes, but we could see\nthem as such for having spent far more time on this planet than the average life\nexpectancy would predict.\nGiven the rise in life expectancy around the world, the number of\nsupercentenarians might also increase. A healthy and purposeful life could help\nus join their ranks.\nLet’s take a look at what a few of them have to say.\nMisao Okawa (117)\n“Eat and sleep, and you’ll live a long time. You have to learn to\nrelax.”\nAccording to the Gerontology Research Group, until April 2015, the oldest living\nperson in the world was Misao Okawa, who passed away in a care facility in\nOsaka, Japan, after living for 117 years and 27 days.\nThe daughter of a textile merchant, she was born in 1898, when Spain lost its\ncolonies in Cuba and the Philippines, and the United States annexed Hawaii and\nlaunched Pepsi-Cola. Until she was 110, this woman—who lived in three\ndifferent centuries—cared for herself unassisted.\nWhen specialists asked about her self-care routine, Misao answered simply,\n“Eating sushi and sleeping,” to which we should add, having a tremendous thirstfor life. When they inquired about her secret for longevity, she answered with a\nsmile, “I ask myself the same thing.”1\nProof that Japan continues to be a factory of long life: In July of the same year\nSakari Momoi passed away at 112 years and 150 days old. At the time he was the\noldest man in the world, though he was younger than fifty-seven women.\nMaría Capovilla (116)\n“I’ve never eaten meat in my life.”\nBorn in Ecuador in 1889, María Capovilla was recognized by Guinness as the\nworld’s oldest person. She died of pneumonia in 2006, at 116 years and 347 days\nold, leaving behind three children, twelve grandchildren, and twenty great-and\ngreat-great-grandchildren.\nShe gave one of her last interviews at age 107, sharing her memories and her\nthoughts:\nI’m happy, and I give thanks to God, who keeps me going. I never thought I’d live so long, I thought I’d\ndie long ago. My husband, Antonio Capovilla, was the captain of a ship. He passed away at 84. We had\ntwo daughters and a son, and now I have many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nThings were better, back in the old days. People behaved better. We used to dance, but we were\nmore restrained; there was this one song I loved dancing to: “María” by Luis Alarcón. I still remember\nmost of the words. I also remember many prayers, and say them every day.\nI like the waltz, and can still dance it. I also still make crafts, I still do some of the things I did when\nI was in school.2\nWhen she had finished recalling her past, she began to dance—one of her\ngreat passions—with an energy that made her seem decades younger.\nWhen asked about her secret for longevity, she responded simply, “I don’t\nknow what the secret to long life is. The only thing I do is I’ve never eaten meat in\nmy life. I attribute it to that.”\nJeanne Calment (122)\n“Everything’s fine.”\nBorn in Arles, France, in February 1875, Jeanne Calment lived until August 4,\n1997, making her, at 122, the oldest person of verified age in history. She\njokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question thatjokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question that\nshe broke numerous records as she went on celebrating birthdays.\nShe died of natural causes at the end of a happy life during which she denied\nherself almost nothing. She rode a bicycle until she turned 100. She lived on her\nown until 110, when she agreed to move into a nursing home after accidentally\nstarting a small fire in her apartment. She stopped smoking at 120, when her\ncataracts started making it hard for her to bring a cigarette to her lips.\nOne of her secrets may have been her sense of humor. As she said on her\n120th birthday, “I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything’s fine.”3\nWalter Breuning (114)\n“If you keep your mind and body busy, you’ll be around a long\ntime.”\nBorn in Minnesota in 1896, Walter Breuning was able to see three centuries in his\nlifetime. He died in Montana in 2011, from natural causes; he’d had two wives\nand a fifty-year career on the railroad. At eighty-three he retired to an assisted\nliving center in Montana, where he remained until his death. He is the second-\noldest man (of verified age) ever born in the United States.\nHe gave many interviews in his final years, insisting that his longevity\nstemmed from, among other things, his habit of eating only two meals per day\nand working for as many years as he could. “Your mind and your body. You keep\nboth busy,” he said on his 112th birthday, “you’ll be here a long time.” Back then,\nhe was still exercising every day.\nAmong Breuning’s other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he\nwasn’t afraid of dying. As he declared in a 2010 interview with the Associated\nPress, “We’re all going to die. Some people are scared of dying. Never be afraid\nto die. Because you’re born to die.”4\nBefore passing away in 2011, he is said to have told a pastor that he’d made a\ndeal with God: If he wasn’t going to get better, it was time to go.\nAlexander Imich (111)\n“I just haven’t died yet.”\nBorn in Poland in 1903, Alexander Imich was a chemist and parapsychologist\nresiding in the United States who, after the death of his predecessor in 2014,residing in the United States who, after the death of his predecessor in 2014,\nbecame the oldest man of authenticated age in the world. Imich himself died\nshortly thereafter, in June of that year, leaving behind a long life rich with\nexperiences.\nImich attributed his longevity to, among other things, never drinking alcohol.\n“It’s not as though I’d won the Nobel Prize,” he said upon being declared the\nworld’s oldest man. “I never thought I’d get to be so old.” When asked about his\nsecret to living so long, his answer was “I don’t know. I just haven’t died yet.”5\nIkigai artists\nThe secret to long life, however, is not held by supercentenarians alone. There are\nmany people of advanced age who, though they haven’t made it into Guinness\nWorld Records, offer us inspiration and ideas for bringing energy and meaning to\nour lives.\nArtists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring,\nhave this power.\nArt, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and purpose to our\ndays. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all human beings have\naccess to.\nHokusai, the Japanese artist who made woodblock prints in the ukiyo-e style\nand lived for 88 years, from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century,\nadded this postscript to the first edition of his One Hundred Views of Mount\nFuji:6\nAll that I have produced before the age of 70 is not worth being counted. It is at the age of 73 that I\nhave somewhat begun to understand the structure of true nature, of animals and grasses, and trees and\nbirds, and fishes and insects; consequently at 80 years of age I shall have made still more progress; at\n90 I hope to have penetrated into the mystery of things; at 100 years of age I should have reached\ndecidedly a marvelous degree, and when I shall be 110, all that I do, every point and every line, shall be\ninstinct with life.\nIn the pages that follow, we’ve collected some of the most inspirational words\nfrom artists interviewed by Camille Sweeney for the New York Times.7 Of those\nstill living, none have retired, and all still enjoy their passion, which they plan to\npursue until their final breath, demonstrating that when you have a clear purpose,\nno one can stop you.The actor Christopher Plummer, still working at eighty-six, reveals a dark\ndesire shared by many who love the profession: “We want to drop dead onstage.\nThat would be a nice theatrical way to go.”8\nOsamu Tezuka, the father of modern Japanese manga, shared this feeling.\nBefore he died in 1989, his last words as he drew one final cartoon were “Please,\njust let me work!”9\nThe eighty-six-year-old filmmaker Frederick Wiseman declared on a stroll\nthrough Paris that he likes to work, which is why he does it with such intensity.\n“Everybody complains about their aches and pains and all that, but my friends are\neither dead or are still working,” he said.10\nCarmen Herrera, a painter who just entered her one hundredth year, sold her\nfirst canvas at age eighty-nine. Today her work is in the permanent collections of\nthe Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art. When asked how she viewed\nher future, she responded, “I am always waiting to finish the next thing. Absurd, I\nknow. I go day by day.”11\nNever Stop Learning\n“You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake\nat night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only\nlove, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know\nyour honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one\nthing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it.\nThat is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate,\nnever be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of\nregretting.”\n—T. H. White, The Once and Future King\nFor his part, naturalist and author Edward O. Wilson asserted, “I feel I have\nenough experience to join those who are addressing big questions. About ten\nyears ago, when I began reading and thinking more broadly about the questions of\nwhat are we, where did we come from and where are we going, I was astonished\nat how little this was being done.”12\nEllsworth Kelly, an artist who passed away in 2015 at the age of ninety-two,\nassured us that the idea that we lose our faculties with age is, in part, a myth,because instead we develop a greater clarity and capacity for observation. “It’s\none thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I’m continuing to see\nnew things. That’s why there are new paintings.”13\nAt eighty-six, the architect Frank Gehry reminds us that some buildings can\ntake seven years “from the time you’re hired until you’re finished,”14 a fact that\nfavors a patient attitude with regard to the passage of time. The man responsible\nfor the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, however, knows how to live in the here and\nnow: “You stay in your time. You don’t go backward. I think if you relate to the\ntime you’re in, you keep your eyes and ears open, read the paper, see what’s going\non, stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time.”15\nLongevity in Japan\nBecause of its robust civil registry, many of those verified as having lived\nthe longest are found in the United States; however, there are many\ncentenarians living in remote villages in other countries. A peaceful life in\nthe countryside seems pretty common among people who have watched a\ncentury pass.\nWithout question, the international superstar of longevity is Japan,\nwhich has the highest life expectancy of any country in the world. In\naddition to a healthy diet, which we will explore in detail, and an\nintegrated health care system in which people go to the doctor for regular\ncheckups to prevent disease, longevity in Japan is closely tied to its\nculture, as we will see later on.\nThe sense of community, and the fact that Japanese people make an\neffort to stay active until the very end, are key elements of their secret to\nlong life.\nIf you want to stay busy even when there’s no need to work, there has\nto be an ikigai on your horizon, a purpose that guides you throughout your\nlife and pushes you to make things of beauty and utility for the\ncommunity and yourself.VI\nLESSONS FROM JAPAN’S CENTENARIANS\nTraditions and proverbs for\nhappiness and longevityOgimi, we had to fly nearly three hours from Tokyo to Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Several months\nTO GET TO\nearlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the\npurpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous\nconversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the\ntown.\nOne year after starting this project, we found ourselves on the doorstep of\nsome of the longest-living people in the world.\nWe realized right away that time seems to have stopped there, as though the\nentire town were living in an endless here and now.\nArriving in Ogimi\nAfter two hours on the road from Naha, we’re finally able to stop worrying about\nthe traffic. To our left are the sea and an empty stretch of beach; to our right, the\nmountainous jungle of Okinawa’s Yanbaru forests.\nOnce Route 58 passes Nago, where Orion beer—the pride of Okinawa—is\nmade, it skirts the coast until it reaches Ogimi. Every now and then a few little\nhouses and stores crop up in the narrow stretch of land between the road and the\nbase of the mountain.\nWe pass small clusters of houses scattered here and there as we enter the\nmunicipality of Ogimi, but the town doesn’t really seem to have a center. Our\nGPS finally guides us to our destination: the Center for the Support and\nPromotion of Well-Being, housed in an unattractive cinderblock building right\noff the highway.\nWe go in through the back door, where a man named Taira is waiting for us.\nBeside him is a petite, cheerful woman who introduces herself as Yuki. Two\nother women immediately get up from desks and show us to a conference room.\nThey serve us each a cup of green tea and a few shikuwasa, a small citrus fruit\nthat packs a big nutritional punch, as we will see later on.\nTaira sits down across from us in his formal suit and opens up a large planner\nand a three-ring binder. Yuki sits next to him. The binder contains a list of all the\ntown’s residents, organized by age and “club,” or moai. Taira points out that these\ngroups of people who help one another are characteristic of Ogimi. The moai arenot organized around any concrete objective; they function more like a family.\nTaira also tells us that volunteer work, rather than money, drives much of what\nhappens in Ogimi. Everyone offers to pitch in, and the local government takes\ncare of assigning tasks. This way, everyone can be useful and feels like a part of\nthe community.\nOgimi is the penultimate town before Cape Hedo, the northernmost point of\nthe largest island in the archipelago.\nFrom the top of one of Ogimi’s mountains, we’re able to look down over the\nwhole town. Almost everything is the green of the Yanbaru jungle, making us\nwonder where the nearly thirty-two hundred residents are hiding. We can see a\nfew houses, but they’re scattered in little clusters near the sea or in small valleys\naccessible by side roads.\nCommunal life\nWe’re invited to eat in one of Ogimi’s few restaurants, but when we arrive the\nonly three tables are already reserved.\n“Don’t worry, we’ll go to Churaumi instead. It never fills up,” says Yuki,\nwalking back to her car.\nShe’s still driving at age eighty-eight, and takes great pride in that. Her copilot\nis ninety-nine, and has also decided to spend the day with us. We have to drive\nfast to keep up with them on a highway that is sometimes more dirt than asphalt.\nFinally reaching the other end of the jungle, we can at last sit down to eat.\n“I don’t really go to restaurants,” Yuki says as we take our seats. “Almost\neverything I eat comes from my vegetable garden, and I buy my fish from\nTanaka, who’s been my friend forever.”\nThe restaurant is right by the sea and seems like something from the planet\nTatooine, from Star Wars. The menu boasts in large letters that it serves “slow\nfood” prepared with organic vegetables grown in the town.\n“But really,” Yuki continues, “food is the least important thing.” She is\nextroverted, and rather pretty. She likes to talk about her role as the director of\nseveral associations run by the local government.\n“Food won’t help you live longer,” she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the\ndiminutive confection that followed our meal. “The secret is smiling and having a\ngood time.”\nThere are no bars and only a few restaurants in Ogimi, but those who live\nthere enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town isthere enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is\ndivided into seventeen neighborhoods, and each one has a president and several\npeople in charge of things like culture, festivals, social activities, and longevity.\nResidents pay close attention to this last category.\nWe’re invited to the community center of one of the seventeen neighborhoods.\nIt is an old building right next to one of the mountains of the Yanbaru jungle,\nhome to bunagaya, the town’s iconic sprites.\nThe Bunagaya Spirits of the Yanbaru Jungle\nBunagaya are magical creatures that inhabit the Yanbaru jungle near\nOgimi and its surrounding towns. They manifest as children with long red\nhair, and like to hide in the jungle’s gajumaru (banyan) trees and go\nfishing on the beach.\nMany of Okinawa’s stories and fables are about bunagaya sprites. They\nare mischievous, playful, and unpredictable. Locals say that the bunagaya\nlove the mountains, rivers, sea, trees, earth, wind, and animals, and that if\nyou want to befriend them, you have to show respect for nature.\nA birthday party\nWhen we arrive at the neighborhood’s community center, we’re greeted by a\ngroup of about twenty people who proudly proclaim, “The youngest among us is\neighty-three!”\nWe conduct our interviews at a large table while drinking green tea. When we\nfinish, we’re brought to an event space, where we celebrate the birthdays of three\nmembers of the group. One woman is turning ninety-nine, another ninety-four,\nand one “young man” has just reached eighty-nine.\nWe sing a few songs popular in the village and finish up with “Happy\nBirthday” in English. The woman turning ninety-nine blows out the candles and\nthanks everyone for coming to her party. We eat homemade shikuwasa cake and\nend up dancing and celebrating as though it were the birthday of a\ntwentysomething.\nIt’s the first party, but not the last, that we’ll attend during our week in the\nvillage. We’ll also do karaoke with a group of seniors who sing better than we do,\nand attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at theand attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at the\nfoot of a mountain.\nCelebrate each day, together\nCelebrations seem to be an essential part of life in Ogimi.\nWe’re invited to watch a game of gateball, one of the most popular sports\namong Okinawa’s older residents. It involves hitting a ball with a mallet-like stick.\nIt is a low-impact sport that can be played anywhere, and is a good excuse to\nmove around and have fun as a group. The residents hold local competitions, and\nthere is no age limit for participants.\nWe participate in the weekly game and lose to a woman who recently turned\n104. Everyone cheers, and the defeated look on our faces elicits laughter.\nIn addition to playing and celebrating as a community, spirituality is also\nessential to the happiness of the village’s residents.\nThe gods of Okinawa\nThe main religion in Okinawa is known as Ryukyu Shinto. Ryukyu is the original\nname of the Okinawa archipelago, and Shinto means “the path of the gods.”1\nRyukyu Shinto combines elements of Chinese Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism,\nand Shintoism with shamanistic and animistic elements.\nAccording to this ancient faith, the world is populated by an infinite number\nof spirits divided into several types: spirits of the home, of the forest, of the trees,\nand of the mountains. It is important to appease these spirits through rituals and\nfestivals, and by consecrating sacred grounds.\nOkinawa is full of sacred jungles and forests, where many of the two main\nkinds of temples are found: the utaki and the uganju. We visited an uganju, or\nsmall, open-air temple adorned with incense and coins, next to a waterfall in\nOgimi. The utaki is a collection of stones where people go to pray and where,\nsupposedly, spirits gather.\nIn Okinawa’s religious practice, women are considered spiritually superior to\nmen, whereas the opposite is true of traditional Shintoism in the rest of Japan.\nYuta are women chosen as mediums by their communities to make contact with\nthe spirit realm through traditional rites.Ancestor worship is another important feature of spiritual practice in\nOkinawa, and in Japan in general. The home of each generation’s firstborn\nusually contains a butsudan, or small altar, used to pray for and make offerings to\nthe family’s ancestors.\nMabui\nEvery person has an essence, or mabui. This mabui is our spirit and the\nsource of our life force. It is immortal and makes us who we are.\nSometimes, the mabui of someone who has died is trapped in the body\nof a living person. This situation requires a separation ritual to free the\nmabui of the deceased; it often happens when a person dies suddenly—\nespecially at a young age—and his or her mabui does not want to move on\nto the realm of the dead.\nA mabui can also be passed from person to person by physical contact.\nA grandmother who leaves her granddaughter a ring transfers a part of her\nmabui to her. Photographs can also be a medium for passing mabui among\npeople.\nThe older, the stronger\nLooking back, our days in Ogimi were intense but relaxed—sort of like the\nlifestyle of the locals, who always seemed to be busy with important tasks but\nwho, upon closer inspection, did everything with a sense of calm. They were\nalways pursuing their ikigai, but they were never in a rush.\nNot only did they seem to be happily busy, but we also noticed that they\nfollowed the other principles for happiness that Washington Burnap stated two\nhundred years ago: “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to\ndo, something to love, and something to hope for.”2\nOn our last day, we went to buy gifts at a small market at the edge of town.\nThe only things sold there are local vegetables, green tea, and shikuwasa juice,\nalong with bottles of water from a spring hidden in the Yanbaru forests, bearing\nlabels that read “Longevity Water.”\nWe bought ourselves some of this Longevity Water and drank it in the parking\nlot, looking out over the sea and hoping that the little bottles that promised amagic elixir would bring us health and long life, and would help us find our own\nikigai. Then we took a photo with a statue of a bunagaya, and walked up to it one\nlast time to read the inscription:\nA Declaration from the Town Where People Live Longest\nAt 80 I am still a child.\nWhen I come to see you at 90,\nsend me away to wait until I’m 100.\nThe older, the stronger;\nlet us not depend too much on our children as we age.\nIf you seek long life and health, you are welcome in our village,\nwhere you will be blessed by nature,\nand together we will discover the secret to longevity.\nApril 23, 1993\nOgimi Federation of Senior Citizen Clubs\nThe interviews\nOver the course of a week we conducted a total of one hundred interviews, asking\nthe eldest members of the community about their life philosophy, their ikigai, and\nthe secrets to longevity. We filmed these conversations with two cameras for use\nin a little documentary, and chose a few especially meaningful and inspiring\nstatements to include in this section of the book.\n1. Don’t worry\n“The secret to a long life is not to worry. And to keep your heart young—don’t let it grow old. Open\nyour heart to people with a nice smile on your face. If you smile and open your heart, your\ngrandchildren and everyone else will want to see you.”\n“The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people. I do it every day. I go\nout there and say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ Then I go home and care for my vegetable garden. In the\nafternoon, I spend time with friends.”\n“Here, everyone gets along. We try not to cause problems. Spending time together and having fun is\nthe only thing that matters.”\n2. Cultivate good habits2. Cultivate good habits\n“I feel joy every morning waking up at six and opening the curtains to look out at my garden, where I\ngrow my own vegetables. I go right outside to check on my tomatoes, my mandarin oranges . . . I love\nthe sight of them—it relaxes me. After an hour in the garden I go back inside and make breakfast.”\n“I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself. That’s my ikigai.”\n“The key to staying sharp in old age is in your fingers. From your fingers to your brain, and back again.\nIf you keep your fingers busy, you’ll live to see one hundred.”\n“I get up at four every day. I set my alarm for that time, have a cup of coffee, and do a little exercise,\nlifting my arms. That gives me energy for the rest of the day.”\n“I eat a bit of everything; I think that’s the secret. I like variety in what I eat; I think it tastes better.”\n“Working. If you don’t work, your body breaks down.”\n“When I wake up, I go to the butsudan and light incense. You have to keep your ancestors in mind. It’s\nthe first thing I do every morning.”\n“I wake up every day at the same time, early, and spend the morning in my vegetable garden. I go\ndancing with my friends once a week.”\n“I do exercise every day, and every morning I go for a little walk.”\n“I never forget to do my taiso exercises when I get up.”\n“Eating vegetables—it helps you live longer.”\n“To live a long time you need to do three things: exercise to stay healthy, eat well, and spend time with\npeople.”\n3. Nurture your friendships every day\n“Getting together with my friends is my most important ikigai. We all get together here and talk—it’s\nvery important. I always know I’ll see them all here tomorrow, and that’s one of my favorite things in\nlife.”\n“My main hobby is getting together with friends and neighbors.”\n“Talking each day with the people you love, that’s the secret to a long life.”\n“I say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ to the children on their way to school, and wave at everyone who\ngoes by me in their car. ‘Drive safely!’ I say. Between 7:20 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., I’m outside on my feet\nthe whole time, saying hello to people. Once everyone’s gone, I go back inside.”“Chatting and drinking tea with my neighbors. That’s the best thing in life. And singing together.”\n“I wake up at five every morning, leave the house, and walk to the sea. Then I go to a friend’s house\nand we have tea together. That’s the secret to long life: getting together with people, and going from\nplace to place.”\n4. Live an unhurried life\n“My secret to a long life is always saying to myself, ‘Slow down,’ and ‘Relax.’ You live much longer if\nyou’re not in a hurry.”\n“I make things with wicker. That’s my ikigai. The first thing I do when I wake up is pray. Then I do my\nexercises and eat breakfast. At seven I calmly start working on my wicker. When I get tired at five, I\ngo visit my friends.”\n“Doing many different things every day. Always staying busy, but doing one thing at a time, without\ngetting overwhelmed.”\n“The secret to long life is going to bed early, waking up early, and going for a walk. Living peacefully\nand enjoying the little things. Getting along with your friends. Spring, summer, fall, winter . . .\nenjoying each season, happily.”\n5. Be optimistic\n“Every day I say to myself, ‘Today will be full of health and energy. Live it to the fullest.’”\n“I’m ninety-eight, but consider myself young. I still have so much to do.”\n“Laugh. Laughter is the most important thing. I laugh wherever I go.”\n“I’m going to live to be a hundred. Of course I am! It’s a huge motivation for me.”\n“Dancing and singing with your grandchildren is the best thing in life.”\n“I feel very fortunate to have been born here. I give thanks for it every day.”\n“The most important thing in Ogimi, in life, is to keep smiling.”\n“I do volunteer work to give back to the village a bit of what it has given to me. For example, I use my\ncar to help friends get to the hospital.”\n“There’s no secret to it. The trick is just to live.”\nKeys to the Ogimi LifestyleOne hundred percent of the people we interviewed keep a vegetable\ngarden, and most of them also have fields of tea, mangoes, shikuwasa,\nand so on.\nAll belong to some form of neighborhood association, where they feel\ncared for as though by family.\nThey celebrate all the time, even little things. Music, song, and dance\nare essential parts of daily life.\nThey have an important purpose in life, or several. They have an ikigai,\nbut they don’t take it too seriously. They are relaxed and enjoy all that\nthey do.\nThey are very proud of their traditions and local culture.\nThey are passionate about everything they do, however insignificant it\nmight seem.\nLocals have a strong sense of yuimaaru—recognizing the connection\nbetween people. They help each other with everything from work in the\nfields (harvesting sugarcane or planting rice) to building houses and\nmunicipal projects. Our friend Miyagi, who ate dinner with us on our\nlast night in town, told us that he was building a new home with the help\nof all his friends, and that we could stay there the next time we were in\nOgimi.\nThey are always busy, but they occupy themselves with tasks that allow\nthem to relax. We didn’t see a single old grandpa sitting on a bench\ndoing nothing. They’re always coming and going—to sing karaoke, visit\nwith neighbors, or play a game of gateball.VII\nTHE IKIGAI DIET\nWhat the world’s longest-living\npeople eat and drinkWorld Health Organization, Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world: 85 years for\nACCORDING TO THE\nmen and 87.3 years for women. Moreover, it has the highest ratio of centenarians in the world: more than\n520 for every million people (as of September 2016).\nSource: World Health Organization, 1966; Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 2004; U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services/CDC, 2005\nThe above graphic, which compares life expectancy in Japan, its province\nOkinawa, Sweden, and the United States, shows that, while life expectancy in\nJapan is high overall, Okinawa exceeds the national average.\nOkinawa is one of the areas in Japan that were most affected by World War II.\nAs a result not only of conflicts on the battlefield but also of hunger and a lack of\nresources once the war ended, the average life expectancy was not very high\nduring the 1940s and 1950s. As Okinawans recovered from the destruction,\nhowever, they came to be some of the country’s longest-living citizens.\nWhat secrets to long life do the Japanese hold? What is it about Okinawa thatWhat secrets to long life do the Japanese hold? What is it about Okinawa that\nmakes it the best of the best in terms of life expectancy?\nExperts point out that, for one thing, Okinawa is the only province in Japan\nwithout trains. Its residents have to walk or cycle when not driving. It is also the\nonly province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s\nrecommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day.\nOkinawa’s miracle diet\nThe mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Okinawa is the lowest in Japan,\nand diet almost certainly has a lot to do with this. It is no coincidence that the\n“Okinawa Diet” is so often discussed around the world at panels on nutrition.\nThe most concrete and widely cited data on diet in Okinawa come from\nstudies by Makoto Suzuki, a cardiologist at the University of the Ryukyus, who\nhas published more than seven hundred scientific articles on nutrition and aging\nin Okinawa since 1970.\nBradley J. Willcox and D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki’s research\nteam and published a book considered the bible on the subject, The Okinawa\nProgram.1 They reached the following conclusions:\nLocals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be\nkey. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different\nfoods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen\ndifferent foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our\nfast-food culture.\nThey eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least\nseven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily\nbasis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to\nmake sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers,\ncarrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color\nand variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are\nthe staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily\ncalories comes from vegetables.\nGrains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every\nday, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as\nwell.They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through\nseveral sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank\na glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a\nsign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.\nIn addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of\nthree times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently\nconsumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week.\nAlong these lines, Makoto Suzuki’s studies indicate the following:\nOkinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of\nJapan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a\npart of their diet.\nThey also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per\nday, compared to an average of 12.\nThey consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to\n2,068 in the rest of Japan. In fact, low caloric intake is common among the\nfive Blue Zones.\nHara hachi bu\nThis brings us back to the 80 percent rule we mentioned in the first chapter, a\nconcept known in Japanese as hara hachi bu. It’s easy to do: When you notice\nyou’re almost full but could have a little more . . . just stop eating!\nOne easy way to start applying the concept of hara hachi bu is to skip dessert.\nOr to reduce portion size. The idea is to still be a little bit hungry when you finish.\nThis is why portion size tends to be much smaller in Japan than in the West.\nFood isn’t served as appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Instead, it’s much more\ncommon to see everything presented at once on small plates: one with rice,\nanother with vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, and something to snack on. Serving\nfood on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and\nfacilitates the varied diet discussed at the beginning of this chapter.\nHara hachi bu is an ancient practice. The twelfth-century book on Zen\nBuddhism Zazen Youjinki recommends eating two-thirds as much as you might\nwant to. Eating less than one might want is common among all Buddhist templesin the East. Perhaps Buddhism recognized the benefits of limiting caloric intake\nmore than nine centuries ago.\nSo, eat less to live longer?\nFew would challenge this idea. Without taking it to the extreme of malnutrition,\nof course, eating fewer calories than our bodies ask for seems to increase\nlongevity. The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating\nfoods with a high nutritional value (especially “superfoods”) and avoiding those\nthat add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value.\nThe calorie restriction we’ve been discussing is one of the most effective ways\nto add years to your life. If the body regularly consumes enough, or too many,\ncalories, it gets lethargic and starts to wear down, expending significant energy on\ndigestion alone.\nAnother benefit of calorie restriction is that it reduces levels of IGF-1\n(insulin-like growth factor 1) in the body. IGF-1 is a protein that plays a\nsignificant role in the aging process; it seems that one of the reasons humans and\nanimals age is an excess of this protein in their blood.2\nWhether calorie restriction will extend lifespan in humans is not yet known,\nbut data increasingly indicate that moderate calorie restriction with adequate\nnutrition has a powerful protective effect against obesity, type 2 diabetes,\ninflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease and reduces metabolic\nrisk factors associated with cancer.3\nAn alternative to following the 80 percent rule on a daily basis is to fast for\none or two days each week. The 5:2 (or fasting) diet recommends two days of\nfasting (consuming fewer than five hundred calories) every week and eating\nnormally on the other five days.\nAmong its many benefits, fasting helps cleanse the digestive system and allows\nit to rest.\n15 natural antioxidants found in the Okinawan diet\nAntioxidants are molecules that slow the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing\nthe free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging. The antioxidant power\nof green tea, for example, is well known, and will be discussed later at greater\nlength.length.\nBecause they are rich in antioxidants and are eaten nearly every day in the\nregion, these fifteen foods are considered keys to Okinawan vitality:\nTofu\nMiso\nTuna\nCarrots\nGoya (bitter melon)\nKombu (sea kelp)\nCabbage\nNori (seaweed)\nOnion\nSoy sprouts\nHechima (cucumber-like gourd)\nSoybeans (boiled or raw)\nSweet potato\nPeppers\nSanpin-cha (jasmine tea)\nSanpin-cha: The reigning infusion in Okinawa\nOkinawans drink more Sanpin-cha—a mix of green tea and jasmine flowers—\nthan any other kind of tea. The closest approximation in the West would be the\njasmine tea that usually comes from China. A 1988 study conducted by Hiroko\nSho at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology indicates that jasmine\ntea reduces blood cholesterol levels.4\nSanpin-cha can be found in many different forms in Okinawa, and is even\navailable in vending machines. In addition to all the antioxidant benefits of green\ntea, it boasts the benefits of jasmine, which include:\nReducing the risk of heart attack\nStrengthening the immune system\nHelping relieve stress\nLowering cholesterol\nOkinawans drink an average of three cups of Sanpin-cha every day.Okinawans drink an average of three cups of Sanpin-cha every day.\nIt might be hard to find exactly the same blend in the West, but we can drink\njasmine tea, or even a high-quality green tea, instead.\nThe secrets of green tea\nGreen tea has been credited for centuries with significant medicinal properties.\nRecent studies have confirmed its many benefits, and have attested to the\nimportance of this ancient plant in the longevity of those who drink it often.\nOriginally from China, where it has been consumed for millennia, green tea\ndidn’t make its way to the rest of the world until just a few centuries ago. Unlike\nother teas, and as a result of being air-dried without fermentation, it retains its\nactive elements even after being dried and crumbled. It offers meaningful health\nbenefits such as:\nControlling cholesterol\nLowering blood sugar levels\nImproving circulation\nProtection against the flu (vitamin C)\nPromoting bone health (fluoride)\nProtection against certain bacterial infections\nProtection against UV damage\nCleansing and diuretic effects\nWhite tea, with its high concentration of polyphenols, may be even more\neffective against aging. In fact, it is considered to be the natural product with the\ngreatest antioxidant power in the world—to the extent that one cup of white tea\nmight pack the same punch as about a dozen glasses of orange juice.\nIn summary: Drinking green or white tea every day can help us reduce the free\nradicals in our bodies, keeping us young longer.\nThe powerful shikuwasa\nShikuwasa is the citrus fruit par excellence of Okinawa, and Ogimi is its largest\nproducer in all of Japan.The fruit is extremely acidic: It is impossible to drink shikuwasa juice without\ndiluting it first with water. Its taste is somewhere between that of a lime and a\nmandarin orange, to which it bears a family resemblance.\nShikuwasas also contain high levels of nobiletin, a flavonoid rich in\nantioxidants.\nAll citrus fruits—grapefruits, oranges, lemons—are high in nobiletin, but\nOkinawa’s shikuwasas have forty times as much as oranges. Consuming nobiletin\nhas been proven to protect us from arteriosclerosis, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and\nobesity in general.\nShikuwasas also contain vitamins C and B , beta carotene, and minerals. They\n1\nare used in many traditional dishes and to add flavor to food, and are squeezed to\nmake juice. While conducting research at the birthday parties of the town’s\n“grandparents,” we were served shikuwasa cake.\nThe Antioxidant Canon, for Westerners\nIn 2010 the UK’s Daily Mirror published a list of foods recommended by\nexperts to combat aging. Among these foods readily available in the West\nare:\nVegetables such as broccoli and chard, for their high concentration of\nwater, minerals, and fiber\nOily fish such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines, for all the\nantioxidants in their fat\nFruits such as citrus, strawberries, and apricots; they are an excellent\nsource of vitamins and help eliminate toxins from the body\nBerries such as blueberries and goji berries; they are rich in\nphytochemical antioxidants\nDried fruits, which contain vitamins and antioxidants, and give you\nenergy\nGrains such as oats and wheat, which give you energy and contain\nminerals\nOlive oil, for its antioxidant effects that show in your skin\nRed wine, in moderation, for its antioxidant and vasodilatory properties\nFoods that should be eliminated are refined sugar and grains, processed\nbaked goods, and prepared foods, along with cow’s milk and all its\nderivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow thederivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow the\nprocess of premature aging.VIII\nGENTLE MOVEMENTS, LONGER LIFE\nExercises from the East that\npromote health and longevityBlue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise\nSTUDIES FROM THE\nbut rather the ones who move the most.\nWhen we visited Ogimi, the Village of Longevity, we discovered that even\npeople over eighty and ninety years old are still highly active. They don’t stay at\nhome looking out the window or reading the newspaper. Ogimi’s residents walk a\nlot, do karaoke with their neighbors, get up early in the morning, and, as soon as\nthey’ve had breakfast—or even before—head outside to weed their gardens. They\ndon’t go to the gym or exercise intensely, but they almost never stop moving in\nthe course of their daily routines.\nAs Easy as Getting out of Your Chair\n“Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The\nenzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where\nit can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol\ndrops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things\ngoing again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,” says Gavin\nBradley1 in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.2\nBradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director\nof an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how\ndetrimental sitting all the time can be to our health.\nIf we live in a city, we might find it hard to move in natural and healthy ways\nevery day, but we can turn to exercises that have proven for centuries to be good\nfor the body.\nThe Eastern disciplines for bringing body, mind, and soul into balance have\nbecome quite popular in the West, but in their countries of origin they have been\nused for ages to promote health.\nYoga—originally from India, though very popular in Japan—and China’s\nqigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a\nperson’s body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and\nserenity.\nThey are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.They are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.\nThese gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits, and are particularly\nappropriate for older individuals who have a harder time staying fit.\nTai chi has been shown, among other things, to slow the development of\nosteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease, to increase circulation, and to improve\nmuscle tone and flexibility. Its emotional benefits are just as important: It is a\ngreat shield against stress and depression.\nYou don’t need to go to the gym for an hour every day or run marathons. As\nJapanese centenarians show us, all you need is to add movement to your day.\nPracticing any of these Eastern disciplines on a regular basis is a great way to do\nso. An added benefit is that they all have well-defined steps, and as we saw in\nchapter IV, disciplines with clear rules are good for flow. If you don’t like any of\nthese disciplines, feel free to choose a practice that you love and that makes you\nmove.\nIn the following pages we’ll take a look at some of the practices that promote\nhealth and longevity—but first, a little appetizer: a singularly Japanese exercise\nfor starting your day.\nRadio taiso\nThis morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The “radio”\npart of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted\nover the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a\ntelevision channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps.\nOne of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity\namong participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools\nbefore the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins.\nStatistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few\nminutes every morning, but radio taiso is one thing that almost everyone we\ninterviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we\nvisited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the\nexercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we\nfelt refreshed for the rest of the day.\nWhen these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a\nlarge reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker.\nThe exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or\nonly some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint\nmobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raisingmobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising\nyour arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It\nis a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity\nand that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible.\nIt might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without\nraising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using\ncomputers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times\nwe raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard\nor closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the\ntime when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the\nbasic movements of the body.\nBasic version of the radio taiso exercises (5 minutes).Yoga\nPopular in Japan as well as in the West, yoga can be done by almost anyone.\nSome of its poses have even been adapted for pregnant women and practitioners\nwith physical disabilities.\nYoga comes from India, where it was developed millennia ago to unite our\nmental and physical elements. The word yoga itself comes from the Sanskrit term\nfor “yoke,” which refers to the crosspiece that binds draft animals to one another\nand to the cart they’re pulling. Yoga strives to unite body and mind in the same\nway, guiding us toward a healthy lifestyle in harmony with the world around us.\nThe main objectives of yoga are:\nTo bring us closer to our (human) nature\nMental and physical purification\nTo bring us closer to the divine\nStyles of yoga\nThough all are oriented toward similar goals, there are many different types of\nyoga that vary according to the traditions and texts from which they were\ndeveloped. The differences among them lie, as the masters say, in the path taken\nto the summit of our best self.\nJnana yoga: the yoga of wisdom; the search for discipline and mental\ngrowth\nKarma yoga: focuses on action, on tasks and duties that benefit oneself and\none’s community\nBhakti yoga: the yoga of devotion and surrender to the divine\nMantra yoga: focuses on the recitation of mantras to reach a state of\nrelaxation\nKundalini yoga: combines diverse steps to reach the desired mental state\nRaja yoga: also known as the royal path; encompasses a range of steps\ngeared toward achieving communion with oneself and others\nHatha yoga: the most widespread form in the West and Japan; characterized\nby asanas or poses combined in a quest for balanceHow to do a Sun Salutation\nThe Sun Salutation is one of the most iconic exercises in hatha yoga. To do it, you\nsimply have to follow these twelve basic movements:\n1. With your feet together, stand up straight but keep your muscles relaxed.\nExhale.\n2. Place the palms of your hands together in front of your chest; from this\nposition, inhale as you raise your arms above your head and bend backward\nslightly.\n3. Exhale as you bend forward until you touch the ground with the palms of\nyour hands, without bending your knees.\n4. Stretch one leg back to touch the floor with the tips of your toes. Inhale.\n5. Bring the other leg back, keeping your legs and arms straight, as you hold\nyour breath.\n6. As you exhale, bend your arms and bring your chest to the ground and then\nforward, resting your knees on the ground.\n7. Straighten your arms and bend your spine back, keeping the lower half of\nyour body on the ground. Inhale.\n8. With your hands and feet on the ground, lift your hips until your arms and\nlegs are straight and your body forms an upside-down V. Exhale throughout\nthe movement.\n9. Bring forward the same leg you’d stretched back earlier and bend it so that\nyour knee and foot are aligned under your head and between your hands.\nInhale.\n10. Exhale as you bring your back foot forward and straighten your legs, keeping\nyour hands on the ground as in posture 3.\n11. Bring your arms above your head with your palms together and bend\nbackward slightly, as you did in posture 2, while you inhale.\n12. Lower your arms to their initial position in mountain pose while you exhale.\nYou’ve just greeted the sun; now you’re ready to have a fantastic day.Tai chi\nAlso known as t’ai chi ch’uan (or taijiquan), tai chi is a Chinese martial art that\ncan be traced back hundreds of years to Buddhism and Confucianism; it is very\npopular in Japan, too.\nAccording to Chinese tradition, it was created by the Taoist master and martial\narts practitioner Zhang Sanfeng, though it was Yang Luchan who in the\nnineteenth century brought the form to the rest of the world.Tai chi was originally a neijia, or internal martial art, meaning its goal was\npersonal growth. Focused on self-defense, it teaches those who practice it to\ndefeat their adversaries by using the least amount of force possible and by relying\non agility.\nTai chi, which was also seen as a means of healing body and mind, would go\non to be used more frequently to foster health and inner peace. To encourage its\ncitizens to be more active, the Chinese government promoted it as an exercise,\nand it lost its original connection to martial arts, becoming instead a source of\nhealth and well-being accessible to all.\nStyles of tai chi\nThere are different schools and styles of tai chi. The following are the best\nknown:\nChen-style: alternates between slow movements and explosive ones\nYang-style: the most widespread of the forms; characterized by slow, fluid\nmovements\nWu-style: utilizes small, slow, deliberate movements\nHao-style: centered on internal movements, with almost microscopic\nexternal movements; one of the least practiced forms of tai chi, even in\nChina\nDespite their differences, these styles all have the same objectives:\n1. To control movement through stillness\n2. To overcome force through finesse\n3. To move second and arrive first\n4. To know yourself and your opponent\nThe ten basic principles of tai chi\nAccording to the master Yang Chengfu, the correct practice of tai chi follows ten\nbasic principles:\n1. Elevate the crown of your head, and focus all your energy there.\n2. Tighten your chest and expand your back to lighten your lower body.3. Relax your waist and let it guide your body.\n4. Learn to differentiate between heaviness and lightness, knowing how your\nweight is distributed.\n5. Relax the shoulders to allow free movement of the arms and promote the\nflow of energy.\n6. Value the agility of the mind over the strength of the body.\n7. Unify the upper and lower body so they act in concert.\n8. Unify the internal and the external to synchronize mind, body, and breath.\n9. Do not break the flow of your movement; maintain fluidity and harmony.\n10. Look for stillness in movement. An active body leads to a calm mind.\nImitating clouds\nOne of the best-known movements in tai chi consists of following the form of\nclouds in an exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds. Here are the steps:\n1. Extend your arms in front of you with your palms down.\n2. Turn your palms to face in, as though you were hugging a tree trunk.\n3. Open your arms out to the side.\n4. Bring the left arm up and center, and the right arm down and center.\n5. Trace the shape of a ball in front of your body.\n6. Turn your left palm toward your face.\n7. Shift your weight to your left foot and pivot from your hip toward that side,\nwhile your eyes follow the movement of your hand.\n8. Bring your left hand to your waist and your right hand in front of your face.\n9. Shift your weight to your right foot.\n10. Pivot toward your right, looking at your raised right hand the entire time.\n11. Repeat this movement fluidly, shifting your weight from one foot to the\nother as you reposition your hands.\n12. Stretch your arms out in front of you again and bring them down slowly,\nreturning to your initial position.Qigong\nAlso known as chi kung, its name combines qi (life force, or energy) and gong\n(work), indicating that the form works with the individual’s life force. Though\nrelatively modern, especially under its current name, the art of qigong is based on\nthe Tao yin, an ancient art meant to foster mental and physical well-being.\nThe practice began to appear in reports on training and martial arts at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, and by the 1930s was being used in hospitals.\nThe Chinese government later popularized it, as it had done with tai chi.\nQigong involves static and dynamic physical exercises that stimulate\nrespiration in a standing, seated, or reclined position. There are many different\nstyles of qigong, but all of them seek to strengthen and regenerate qi. Though its\nmovements are typically gentle, the practice is intense.\nBenefits of qigong\nAccording to numerous international scientific studies, qigong—like tai chi and\nyoga—offers significant health benefits. The following stand out among thoseproven through scientific research, as observed by Dr. Kenneth M. Sancier of San\nFrancisco’s Qigong Institute in his article “Medical Applications of Qigong”3:\nModification of brain waves\nImproved balance of sex hormones\nLower mortality rate from heart attacks\nLower blood pressure in patients with hypertension\nGreater bone density\nBetter circulation\nDeceleration of symptoms associated with senility\nGreater balance and efficiency of bodily functions\nIncreased blood flow to the brain and greater mind-body connection\nImproved cardiac function\nReduction in the secondary effects of cancer treatments\nPracticing these arts not only keeps us in shape, it also helps extend our lives.\nMethods for practicing qigong\nIn order to practice qigong correctly, we should remember that our life energy\nflows through our whole body. We should know how to regulate its many parts:\n1. Tyau Shenn: (regulating the body) by adopting the correct posture—it is\nimportant to be firmly rooted to the ground\n2. Tyau Shyi: (regulating the breath) until it is calm, steady, and peaceful\n3. Tyau Hsin: (regulating the mind); the most complicated part, as it implies\nemptying the mind of thoughts\n4. Tyau Chi: (regulating the life force) through the regulation of the three prior\nelements, so that it flows naturally\n5. Tyau Shen: (regulating the spirit); the spirit is both strength and root in battle,\nas Yang Jwing-Ming explains in The Essence of Taiji Qigong.4\nIn this way, the whole organism will be prepared to work together toward a\nsingle goal.\nThe five elements of qigong\nOne of qigong’s best-known exercises is a series representing the five elements:One of qigong’s best-known exercises is a series representing the five elements:\nearth, water, wood, metal, and fire. This series of movements seeks to balance the\nfive currents of energy in order to improve brain and organ function.\nThere are several ways to do these movements. In this case, we’re following\nthe model of Professor María Isabel García Monreal from the Qigong Institute in\nBarcelona.\nEARTH\n1. Stand with your legs apart and your feet directly below your shoulders.\n2. Turn your feet outward slightly to strengthen the posture.\n3. Keep your shoulders relaxed and down and your arms loose at your sides,\nslightly away from your body (this is the Wu Qi, or rooted, posture).\n4. As you inhale, raise your arms in front of you until your hands are level with\nyour shoulders, your palms facing down.\n5. Exhale as you bend your knees and bring your arms down until your hands\nare level with your stomach, your palms facing in.\n6. Hold this position for a few seconds, focusing on your breath.\nWATER1. Starting from Earth posture, bend your knees into a squat, keeping your chest\nupright and exhaling throughout.\n2. Press your coccyx downward to stretch your lumbar spine.\n3. As you inhale, stand to return to Earth posture.\n4. 4. Repeat twice, for a total of three.\nWOOD\n1. Starting from Earth posture, turn your palms upward and open your arms to\nthe side, forming a circle as you inhale, until your hands are level with your\nclavicle. Turn your hands so that your palms and elbows point downward,\nwhile keeping your shoulders relaxed.\n2. Reverse the movement as you exhale, making a downward circle with your\narms until you reach your initial position.\n3. Repeat twice, for a total of three.METAL\n1. Starting from Earth posture, raise your arms until your hands are level with\nyour sternum.\n2. Turn your palms toward each other, about four inches apart, with your\nfingers relaxed and slightly separated, pointing upward.\n3. As you inhale, move your hands away from each other until they are shoulder\nwidth apart.\n4. As you exhale, bring your hands toward each other until they are back in\nposition 2.\n5. Repeat twice, for a total of three, observing the concentration of energy as\nyou bring your hands together in front of your lungs.FIRE\n1. Starting from Earth posture, bring your hands level with your heart as you\ninhale, with one hand slightly above the other and your palms facing each\nother.\n2. Rotate your hands to feel the energy of your heart.\n3. Turn from your waist gently to the left, keeping your torso relaxed and your\nforearms parallel to the ground.\n4. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up\nuntil it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your\nabdomen.\n5. Turn from your waist gently to the right, keeping your torso relaxed and your\nforearms parallel to the ground.\n6. As you exhale, let your hands come back together in front of your heart.\n7. With your palms still facing each other, separate your hands, bringing one up\nuntil it is level with your shoulder, and the other down in front of your\nabdomen.COMPLETING THE SERIES\n1. Starting from Earth posture, inhale as you bring your hands level with your\nshoulders, palms facing down.\n2. As you exhale, lower your arms to rest at your sides, returning to the initial\nWu Qi posture.\nShiatsuCreated in Japan in the early twentieth century, principally for the treatment of\narthritis, shiatsu also works on energy flow through the application of pressure\nwith the thumbs and the palms of the hands. In combination with stretching and\nbreathing exercises, it seeks to create equilibrium among the different elements\nof the body.\nIt is not important that a Tao Yin* have a name, is imitating something, or is\nengraved in jade. What is important is the technique and the essence of\nwhat is really practiced. Stretching and contracting, bending and lifting of\nthe head, stepping, lying down, resting or standing, walking or stepping\nslowly, screaming or breathing—everything can be a Tao Yin.\n—Ge Hong5\nBreathe better, live longer\nThe book Xiuzhen shishu, known in the West as Ten Books on the Cultivation of\nPerfection, dates back to the thirteenth century and is a compendium of materials\nfrom diverse sources on developing the mind and body.\nIt quotes, among others, the celebrated Chinese doctor and essayist Sun\nSimiao, who lived during the sixth century. Sun Simiao was a proponent of a\ntechnique called the Six Healing Sounds, which involves the coordination of\nmovement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our\nsouls to a place of calm.\nThe six sounds are:\nXu, pronounced like “shh” with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liver\nHe, pronounced like “her” with a yawn, which is associated with the heart\nSi, pronounced like “sir” with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungs\nChui, pronounced like “chwee” with a forceful exhale, which is associated\nwith the kidneys\nHoo, pronounced like “who,” which is associated with the spleen\nXi, pronounced like “she, ” which connects the whole body\nThe following poem by Sun Simiao offers clues about how to live well\naccording to the season. It reminds us of the importance of breathing, andsuggests that as we breathe, we visualize the organs associated with each of the\nhealing sounds.\nIn spring, breathe xu for clear eyes and so wood can aid your liver.\nIn summer, reach for he, so that heart and fire can be at peace.\nIn fall, breathe si to stabilize and gather metal, keeping the lungs moist.\nFor the kidneys, next, breathe chui and see your inner waters calm.\nThe Triple Heater needs your xi to expel all heat and troubles.\nIn all four seasons, take deep breaths so your spleen can process food.\nAnd, of course, avoid exhaling noisily; don’t let even your own ears hear you.\nThe practice is most excellent and will help preserve your divine elixir.\nIt might feel confusing to be presented with all the Eastern traditions we have\nintroduced in this chapter. The takeaway is that they all combine a physical\nexercise with an awareness of our breath. These two components—movement\nand breath—help us to bring our consciousness in line with our body, instead of\nallowing our mind to be carried away by the sea of daily worries. Most of the\ntime, we are just not aware enough of our breathing.IX\nRESILIENCE AND WABI-SABI\nHow to face life’s challenges\nwithout letting stress and worry age\nyouWhat is resilience?\nOne thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they\npursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards\nseem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another.\nWe’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among\npsychologists.\nBut resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it\nis also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life\nrather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by\nnegative emotions.\nIn the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond\nresilience to cultivate antifragility.\nSooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this\ncan make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind,\nbody, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs.\nNana korobi ya oki 七転び八起き\nFall seven times, rise eight.\n—Japanese proverb\nResilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the\neasier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our\nlives.\nResilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what\nmatters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of\ntheir strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune.\nThey concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they\ncan’t.\nIn the words of the famous Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr:\nGod, give us grace to accept with serenity\nthe things that cannot be changed,\nCourage to change the things\nwhich should be changed,\nand the Wisdom to distinguish\nthe one from the other.the one from the other.\nEmotional resilience through Buddhism and Stoicism\nSiddhārtha Gautama (Buddha) was born a prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal, and grew\nup in a palace, surrounded by riches. At sixteen he married and had a child.\nNot satisfied by his family’s wealth, at twenty-nine he decided to try a\ndifferent lifestyle and ran away from the palace to live as an ascetic. But it wasn’t\nasceticism that he was looking for; it didn’t offer the happiness and well-being he\nsought. Neither wealth nor extreme asceticism worked for him. He realized that a\nwise person should not ignore life’s pleasures. A wise person can live with these\npleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by\nthem.\nZeno of Citium began his studies with the Cynics. The Cynics also led ascetic\nlives, leaving behind all earthly pleasures. They lived in the street, and the only\nthing they owned was the clothing on their backs.\nSeeing that Cynicism did not give him a sense of well-being, Zeno abandoned\nits teachings to found the school of Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there\nis nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control\nof your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to\ndisappear.\nThe goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, as in\nCynicism, but to eliminate negative emotions.\nSince their inception, one of the objectives of both Buddhism and Stoicism\nhas been to control pleasure, emotions, and desires. Though the philosophies are\nvery different, both aim to curb our ego and control our negative emotions.\nBoth Stoicism and Buddhism are, at their roots, methods for practicing well-\nbeing.\nAccording to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can\nenjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who\nwere able to control their emotions as virtuous.\nWhat’s the worst thing that could happen?\nWe finally land our dream job, but after a little while we are already hunting for a\nbetter one. We win the lottery and buy a nice car but then decide we can’t live\nwithout a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve beenwithout a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve been\npining for and suddenly find we have a wandering eye.\nPeople can be insatiable.\nThe Stoics believed that these kinds of desires and ambitions are not worth\npursuing. The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility\n(apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity,\nand anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity,\nand gratitude.\nIn order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like\nnegative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order\nto be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them.\nTo practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but\nwithout worrying about them.\nSeneca, one of the richest men in ancient Rome, lived a life of luxury but was,\nnonetheless, an active Stoic. He recommended practicing negative visualization\nevery night before falling asleep. In fact, he not only imagined these negative\nsituations, he actually put them into practice—for example, by living for a week\nwithout servants, or the food and drink he was used to as a wealthy man. As a\nresult, he was able to answer the question “What’s the worst thing that could\nhappen?”\nMeditating for healthier emotions\nIn addition to negative visualization and not giving in to negative emotions,\nanother central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we\ncan’t, as we see in the Serenity Prayer.\nWorrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We\nshould have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn\nwill allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions.\nIn the words of Epictetus, “It’s not what happens to you, but how you react that\nmatters.”1\nIn Zen Buddhism, meditation is a way to become aware of our desires and\nemotions and thereby free ourselves from them. It is not simply a question of\nkeeping the mind free of thoughts but instead involves observing our thoughts\nand emotions as they appear, without getting carried away by them. In this way,\nwe train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment.One of the most commonly used mantras in Buddhism focuses on controlling\nnegative emotions: “Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ,” in which oṃ is the generosity that\npurifies the ego, ma is the ethics that purifies jealousy, ṇi is the patience that\npurifies passion and desire, pad is the precision that purifies bias, me is the\nsurrender that purifies greed, and hūṃ is the wisdom that purifies hatred.\nThe here and now, and the impermanence of things\nAnother key to cultivating resilience is knowing in which time to live. Both\nBuddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the\nonly thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we\nshould appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now.\n“The only moment in which you can be truly alive is the present moment,”\nobserves the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.\nIn addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on\nthe impermanence of the things around us.\nThe Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said that the things we love are like the\nleaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. He also said\nthat changes in the world around us are not accidental but rather form part of the\nessence of the universe—a rather Buddhist notion, in fact.\nWe should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will\ndisappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without\ngiving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have\nto make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who\nsurround us.\n“All things human are short-lived and perishable,” Seneca tells us.2\nThe temporary, ephemeral, and impermanent nature of the world is central to\nevery Buddhist discipline. Keeping this always in mind helps us avoid excessive\npain in times of loss.\nWabi-sabi and ichi-go ichi-e\nWabi-sabi is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting,\nchangeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. Instead of searching for\nbeauty in perfection, we should look for it in things that are flawed, incomplete.\nThis is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular orThis is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular or\ncracked teacup. Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can\ntruly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world.\nA complementary Japanese concept is that of ichi-go ichi-e, which could be\ntranslated as “This moment exists only now and won’t come again.” It is heard\nmost often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter—whether with\nfriends, family, or strangers—is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that\nwe should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or\nthe future.\nThe concept is commonly used in tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and\nJapanese martial arts, all of which place emphasis on being present in the\nmoment.\nIn the West, we’ve grown accustomed to the permanence of the stone\nbuildings and cathedrals of Europe, which sometimes gives us the sense that\nnothing changes, making us forget about the passage of time. Greco-Roman\narchitecture adores symmetry, sharp lines, imposing facades, and buildings and\nstatues of the gods that outlast the centuries.\nJapanese architecture, on the other hand, doesn’t try to be imposing or perfect,\nbecause it is built in the spirit of wabi-sabi. The tradition of making structures out\nof wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to\nrebuild them. Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and\neverything we create.\nThe Grand Shrine of Ise,3 for example, has been rebuilt every twenty years for\ncenturies. The most important thing is not to keep the building standing for\ngenerations, but to preserve customs and traditions—things that can withstand the\npassage of time better than structures made by human hands.\nThe key is to accept that there are certain things over which we have no\ncontrol, like the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of the world around us.\nIchi-go ichi-e teaches us to focus on the present and enjoy each moment that\nlife brings us. This is why it is so important to find and pursue our ikigai.\nWabi-sabi teaches us to appreciate the beauty of imperfection as an\nopportunity for growth.\nBeyond resilience: Antifragility\nAs the legend goes, the first time Hercules faced the Hydra, he despaired when\nhe discovered that cutting off one of its heads meant that two would grow back in\nits place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with everyits place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with every\nwound.\nAs Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains in Antifragile: Things That Gain from\nDisorder,4 we use the word fragile to describe people, things, and organizations\nthat are weakened when harmed, and the words robust and resilient for things that\nare able to withstand harm without weakening, but we don’t have a word for\nthings that get stronger when harmed (up to a point).\nTo refer to the kind of power possessed by the Hydra of Lerna, to talk about\nthings that get stronger when they are harmed, Taleb proposes the term\nantifragile: “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists\nshocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”\nCatastrophes and exceptional circumstances offer good models for explaining\nantifragility. In 2011 a tsunami hit the Tōhoku region of Japan, doing tremendous\ndamage to dozens of cities and towns along the coast, most famously Fukushima.\nWhen we visited the affected coast two years after the catastrophe, having\ndriven for hours along cracked highways and past one empty gas station after\nanother, we passed through several ghost towns whose streets had been taken over\nby the remnants of houses, piles of cars, and empty train stations. These towns\nwere fragile spaces that had been forgotten by the government and could not\nrecover on their own.\nOther places, such as Ishinomaki and Kesennuma, suffered extensive damage\nbut were rebuilt within a few years, thanks to the efforts of many. Ishinomaki and\nKesennuma showed how resilient they were in their ability to return to normal\nafter the catastrophe.\nThe earthquake that caused the tsunami also affected the Fukushima nuclear\npower plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company engineers working at the plant\nwere not prepared to recover from that kind of damage. The Fukushima nuclear\nfacility is still in a state of emergency and will be for decades to come. It\ndemonstrated its fragility in the face of an unprecedented catastrophe.\nThe Japanese financial markets closed minutes after the earthquake. Which\nbusinesses did the best in the aftermath? Stock in big construction companies has\nbeen steadily on the rise since 2011; the need to rebuild the entire coast of\nTōhoku is a boon for construction. In this case, Japanese construction companies\nare antifragile, since they benefited enormously from the catastrophe.\nNow let’s take a look at how we can apply this concept to our daily lives. How\ncan we be more antifragile?\nStep 1: Create redundanciesStep 1: Create redundancies\nInstead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your\nhobbies, at other jobs, or by starting your own business. If you have only one\nsalary, you might be left with nothing should your employer run into trouble,\nleaving you in a position of fragility. On the other hand, if you have several\noptions and you lose your primary job, it might just happen that you end up\ndedicating more time to your secondary job, and maybe even make more money\nat it. You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case,\nantifragile.\nOne hundred percent of the seniors we interviewed in Ogimi had a primary\nand a secondary occupation. Most of them kept a vegetable garden as a secondary\njob, and sold their produce at the local market.\nThe same idea goes for friendships and personal interests. It’s just a matter, as\nthe saying goes, of not putting all your eggs in one basket.\nIn the sphere of romantic relationships, there are those who focus all their\nenergy on their partner and make him or her their whole world. Those people lose\neverything if the relationship doesn’t work out, whereas if they’ve cultivated\nstrong friendships and a full life along the way, they’ll be in a better position to\nmove on at the end of a relationship. They’ll be antifragile.\nRight now you might be thinking, “I don’t need more than one salary, and I’m\nhappy with the friends I’ve always had. Why should I add anything new?” It might\nseem like a waste of time to add variation to our lives, because extraordinary\nthings don’t ordinarily happen. We slip into a comfort zone. But the unexpected\nalways happens, sooner or later.\nStep 2: Bet conservatively in certain areas and take many small\nrisks in others\nThe world of finance turns out to be very useful in explaining this concept. If you\nhave $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixed-\nterm deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth\npotential—say, $100 in each.\nOne possible scenario is that three of the companies fail (you lose $300), the\nvalue of three other companies goes down (you lose another $100 or $200), the\nvalue of three goes up (you make $100 or $200), and the value of one of the start-\nups increases twenty-fold (you make nearly $2,000, or maybe even more).\nYou still make money, even if three of the businesses go completely belly-up.\nYou’ve benefited from the damage, just like the Hydra.You’ve benefited from the damage, just like the Hydra.\nThe key to becoming antifragile is taking on small risks that might lead to\ngreat reward, without exposing ourselves to dangers that might sink us, such as\ninvesting $10,000 in a fund of questionable reputation that we saw advertised in\nthe newspaper.\nStep 3: Get rid of the things that make you fragile\nWe’re taking the negative route for this exercise. Ask yourself: What makes me\nfragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us and make us\nvulnerable. Who and what are they?\nWhen we make our New Year’s resolutions, we tend to emphasize adding new\nchallenges to our lives. It’s great to have this kind of objective, but setting “good\nriddance” goals can have an even bigger impact. For example:\nStop snacking between meals\nEat sweets only once a week\nGradually pay off all debt\nAvoid spending time with toxic people\nAvoid spending time doing things we don’t enjoy, simply because we feel\nobligated to do them\nSpend no more than twenty minutes on Facebook per day\nTo build resilience into our lives, we shouldn’t fear adversity, because each\nsetback is an opportunity for growth. If we adopt an antifragile attitude, we’ll find\na way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused\non our ikigai.\nTaking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that\nwe can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set\nnew and better goals. As Taleb writes in Antifragile, “We need randomness, mess,\nadventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things\nthat make life worth living.” We encourage those interested in the concept of\nantifragility to read Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile.\nLife is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the\npassage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense\nof your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem\nalmost like an eternity.EPILOGUE\nIkigai: The art of living\nMitsuo Aida was one of the most important calligraphers and haikuists of the\ntwentieth century. He is yet another example of a Japanese person who dedicated\nhis life to a very specific ikigai: communicating emotions with seventeen-syllable\npoems, using a shodo calligraphy brush.\nMany of Aida’s haikus philosophize about the importance of the present\nmoment, and the passage of time. The poem reproduced below could be\ntranslated as “In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.”\nいまここにしかないわたし\nのいのちあなたのいのち\nIn another poem, Aida writes simply, “Here, now.” It is an artwork that seeks\nto evoke feelings of mono no aware (a melancholy appreciation of the\nephemeral).\nいまここ\nThe following poem touches on one of the secrets of bringing ikigai into our\nlives: “Happiness is always determined by your heart.”\nしあわせはいつも自分の心がきめる\nThis last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.”This last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.”\nそのままでいいがな\nOnce you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring\nmeaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a\nhappy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef\nwho, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love.\nConclusion\nOur ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we\nare all searching for meaning. When we spend our days feeling connected to what\nis meaningful to us, we live more fully; when we lose the connection, we feel\ndespair.\nModern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very\neasy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives\n(money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take\nover your life.\nOur intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us\nconnect with our ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or\nchange those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things\nthat fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we\nmight find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors.\nThere is no perfect strategy to connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned\nfrom the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it.\nLife is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that\nkeeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who\nlove you.\nThe ten rules of ikigai\nWe’ll conclude this journey with ten rules we’ve distilled from the wisdom of the\nlong-living residents of Ogimi:1. Stay active; don’t retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and\ndo well lose their purpose in life. That’s why it’s so important to keep doing\nthings of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping\nout, and shaping the world around you, even after your “official” professional\nactivity has ended.\n2. Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As\nthe old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency\nbehind, life and time take on new meaning.\n3. Don’t fill your stomach. Less is more when it comes to eating for long life,\ntoo. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should\neat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.\n4. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine,\nthere for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your\nday, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.\n5. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it\nflows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit\nof daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases\nhormones that make us feel happy.\n6. Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends.\nIt’s good to recognize the things that aren’t so great, but we should never forget\nwhat a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.\n7. Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days,\nhuman beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it\noften to recharge our batteries.\n8. Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air\nyou breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that\nbrightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every\nday giving thanks, and you’ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.\n9. Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today\nis all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.\n10. Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that\ngives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the\nvery end. If you don’t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your\nmission is to discover it.\nThe authors of this book wish you a long, happy, and purposeful life.\nThank you for joining us,\nHÉCTOR GARCÍA AND FRANCESC MIRALLESNOTES\nChapter I.
